# Chapter 28: The Choice

We stand there in the fairgrounds parking lot for a moment, the sounds of the demolition derby drifting over from the arena. Engines roaring, metal crunching, the crowd cheering. All the destruction I walked away from.

"I should go," I say finally. "I need to... I don't know. Think. Process. Something."

Claire nods. "Okay."

But neither of us moves.

"Thank you," I say. "For showing up. For stopping me from making the biggest mistake of my life."

"Second biggest," Claire says with a small smile. "The first would've been not showing up at all this summer."

She's probably right about that.

"Where will you go?" she asks.

I look at the Chevy. At the car that's still whole, still beautiful, still proof that I can build something good.

"Your farm," I say. "If that's okay. I need to... I need to talk to you. Properly. Not here."

"I'll meet you there," Claire says.

She turns and heads toward her father's truck—I hadn't even noticed it parked nearby. She must've driven here alone, must've come looking for me the minute she figured out what I was about to do.

She cared enough to stop me.

I get into the Chevy and start the engine. My hands are shaking on the wheel. Not from adrenaline this time—from something else. Fear, maybe. Or the terrifying realization that I just chose hope over destruction, and now I have to figure out what that means.

I drive out of the fairgrounds, past the carnival lights and the families and all the normal Saturday night activities. It's still early—barely past seven. The whole town is at the fair.

Which means the Henderson farm will be empty. Quiet. Just me and Claire and whatever truth I'm about to tell her.

The drive takes ten minutes. Ten minutes of gripping the steering wheel too hard and trying to breathe normally and failing completely.

I'm going to tell her. Really tell her. No more half-confessions or talking around it or pretending I don't feel what I feel.

I'm going to tell Claire Henderson that I'm in love with her.

And I have absolutely no idea what she'll say.

By the time I pull into the Henderson farmyard, my heart's pounding so hard I can feel it in my throat. Claire's truck is already there—she must've driven fast, or I drove slow, or both.

I park next to her truck and kill the engine. Sit there for a second, trying to work up the courage to get out.

This is it. This is where I either tell the truth and risk everything, or I chicken out and spend the rest of my life wondering what if.

I choose truth.

I get out of the Chevy and stand there in the farmyard. The sun's almost set now, everything painted in shades of purple and orange. It's beautiful in a way that makes my chest ache.

Claire's sitting on the porch steps, waiting. She stands when she sees me.

We're maybe twenty feet apart. It feels like miles.

"Hi," I say stupidly.

"Hi."

"I'm glad you came," I say. "To the derby. I'm glad you stopped me."

"Me too."

We're being too polite. Too careful. Like we're strangers instead of two people who've spent the entire summer working side by side.

"I need to tell you something," I say. The words come out rough, desperate. "I need to tell you the truth about why I was going to wreck the car. About why I'm here instead of there. About... everything."

Claire doesn't say anything. Just waits. Patient like always.

I take a breath. Let it out slowly. Count to three.

Then I just say it.

"I'm terrified."

The confession hangs in the evening air.

"Of what?" Claire asks gently.

"Of everything." I run my hand through my hair, trying to find the words. "I'm terrified that I haven't really changed. That I'm still just the angry kid who's going to end up like his father. That this whole summer was just pretending and sooner or later the real me is going to come out and destroy everything good I've managed to build."

I'm pacing now, the words spilling out faster.

"I'm terrified that I don't know how to be anything except angry. That I don't know how to live without the rage because it's all I've ever known. That if I let it go, there won't be anything left of me."

I stop pacing. Look at Claire standing there on the porch in the fading light.

"I'm terrified of wanting something good and not being able to keep it."

"Rick—"

"Let me finish," I say. "Please. Because if I don't say this now, I might never say it."

She nods.

I take another breath.

"I was going to wreck the car because I thought it would prove something. That I'm different now. That I'm done with the old Rick Dalton who solved everything with speed and destruction. But you were right—I was just running away. Just choosing destruction because it's familiar and safe and what everyone expects."

I move closer to the porch. Closer to her.

"But I'm done with that. I'm done letting fear make my choices. Done letting anger run my life. Done believing that I'm worthless because that's what my father says and what the town thinks and what I've always been told."

My voice is stronger now. Certain.

"I want to be better," I say. "Not because I'm trying to prove anyone wrong. Not because Tom Henderson gave me a second chance or because Sheriff Webb is waiting for me to fail. Not even because the town is watching to see if a Dalton can actually change."

I'm at the bottom of the porch steps now. Looking up at Claire.

"I want to be better for myself. Because I'm tired of being angry all the time. Because I want to build things instead of destroy them. Because I spent two years creating that car from scrap metal and it felt good, and I want more of that. I want to create instead of destruct. I want to fix instead of break. I want to be someone I can actually be proud of."

Claire's eyes are bright. Watching me like I'm the only thing in the world that matters.

"And I want to be better for you," I say quietly.

There it is. The truth I've been dancing around all summer.

"For me?" Claire's voice is soft.

"Yeah." I grip the porch railing, my knuckles white. "Because you saw something in me that I didn't see in myself. Because you taught me to breathe instead of explode. Because you believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. Because you've spent all summer making me want to be worthy of the way you look at me."

My throat is tight. My hands are shaking.

But I'm not stopping now.

"I'm in love with you, Claire Henderson."

The words are out. Hanging in the evening air between us. No taking them back now.

"I'm completely, terrifyingly in love with you," I continue. "And I have no idea what to do about it. Because I'm Rick Dalton from the wrong side of town with a drunk for a father and a reputation that follows me everywhere. And you're Claire Henderson with your whole life ahead of you and dreams of agricultural school and a future that shouldn't include someone like me."

I'm breathing hard now, like I've been running.

"But I love you. And walking away from that demolition derby tonight, choosing not to destroy what I built, choosing hope over fear—that was for you. Because you make me want to be better. You make me believe I can be better. You make me think that maybe, just maybe, I'm worth something more than my father's name and my own worst fears."

I stop talking. I've said everything I came here to say. Everything I've been holding in all summer.

Now it's her turn.

Claire's still standing on the porch, and I can't read her expression in the fading light. Can't tell if I just made the best decision of my life or the worst.

"Rick," she says finally.

"Yeah?"

"Come up here."

I climb the porch steps on shaking legs. Stand in front of her, heart pounding, waiting for her to tell me she's flattered but I'm wrong for her. That her father would never allow it. That she has plans that don't include a hothead mechanic from the wrong side of town.

Waiting for the rejection I've been expecting all summer.

But that's not what she says.

"I love you too," Claire says.

And the world stops.

"You... what?"

"I love you too," she repeats, and there's a smile in her voice now. "I have since the day you punched that fence post and I asked what you were really angry about. Since you actually answered. Since you let me see past all the rage to what was really underneath."

She takes a step closer.

"You think you're wrong for me?" she says. "You think your reputation matters more than who you actually are? You think I care what side of town you're from?"

"You should," I say. "Everyone else does."

"Everyone else isn't me."

She's right in front of me now. Close enough that I can see her eyes clearly, see the certainty there.

"I don't love 'someone like you,'" Claire says. "I love you. Rick Dalton. The guy who rebuilt a car from scrap metal. The guy who worked all summer to pay his debts. The guy who learned to breathe through anger instead of letting it control him. The guy who chose not to destroy something beautiful because he was scared."

She reaches up and touches my face, gentle on the faded bruises.

"I love you," she says again. "And I think you're exactly worth what I think you are."

I can't breathe. Can't think. Can't do anything except stand there and try to process that Claire Henderson just said she loves me.

"I don't know what to do," I admit.

"About what?"

"About this. About us. About what happens next."

Claire smiles. "We figure it out. Together. One day at a time. Just like you've been doing all summer."

One day at a time. One choice at a time. Building instead of destroying. Choosing hope over fear.

With Claire.

"Okay," I say.

"Okay?"

"Yeah. Okay. We'll figure it out."

And then, because I've been wanting to do this for months and because she said she loves me and because for the first time in my life I'm choosing hope—

I kiss her.
