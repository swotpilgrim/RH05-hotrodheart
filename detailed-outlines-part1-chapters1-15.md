4. Rick slams hammer in frustration when a stubborn post won't budge; expects reaction but Claire doesn't flinch, just keeps working
5. At noon, Claire hands him water and makes observation: "You're stronger than you think you are. You're just angry about being here." Rick is thrown off by her directness.

**Dialogue Topics:** Claire's brief instructions about tools and tasks, Rick's terse questions about what needs doing, Claire's unexpected comment about his strength and anger, minimal small talk

4. Friday afternoon, Rick's frustration peaks; throws toolbox across work area, scattering wrenches everywhere, breathing hard
5. Claire stops working, looks at him calmly: "You want me to fire you, don't you?" Rick doesn't answer. She says, "I'm not going to. You made a deal and you're going to keep it. Now pick up the tools."

**Dialogue Topics:** Rick's sarcastic comments about farm work and "respectable" farm families, Claire's mild agreements that don't give him the fight he wants, her direct question about wanting to be fired, her firm statement that he'll keep his word

4. They develop working rhythm: Rick handles heavy lifting and repairs, Claire manages garden replanting and directs what needs doing; Rick starts noticing things about her despite himself
5. Rick observes: Claire handles tools with same confidence he handles engine parts, knows which fence boards are rotting without testing, hums sometimes when she thinks he's not listening; Rick realizes he's stopped counting days until summer ends

**Dialogue Topics:** Minimal work-related exchanges ("Hand me that hammer," "North fence needs attention"), comfortable silence between them, Claire's unconscious humming

**Emotional Arc:** Rick's active resentment fades into acceptance of the routine. Beginning to see Claire as competent and interesting rather than just warden. Notices himself not hating this as much as he expected.

4. Rick misses the post, hits ground; swings again, misses again; third swing hits post at wrong angle, hammer rebounds; Rick loses it—throws hammer, kicks post, punches it with bare knuckles
