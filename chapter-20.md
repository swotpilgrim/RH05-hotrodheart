# Chapter 20: The Aftermath

For a long moment, nobody moves. Nobody speaks. The three of us just stand there in the farmyard with blood on the ground and the fence broken and the whole summer lying in ruins around us.

Then Tom Henderson takes a breath and turns to his daughter.

"Claire," he says quietly. "Go on up to the house."

"But Dad—"

"Now, please."

There's something in his voice that doesn't leave room for argument. Claire looks at me one more time—that same shocked, frozen expression—and then she turns and walks toward the farmhouse. Her steps are careful, measured, like she's trying very hard to hold herself together.

I watch her go. Watch the door close behind her. And I know with absolute certainty that this is the last time she'll ever look at me as anything other than exactly what I am: a violent kid from the wrong side of town who she was stupid enough to believe in.

Henderson waits until Claire's inside. Then he turns to me, and I brace myself for what's coming.

The anger. The disappointment. The call to Sheriff Webb saying the deal's off, press charges, get this violent piece of trash off my property.

I deserve all of it and worse.

But Henderson doesn't yell. His voice when he speaks is quiet. Almost sad.

"I've seen men fight their fathers before," he says.

I blink. That's not what I expected.

"Saw my own brother go at it with our dad when I was about your age. Ugly business. My father had a temper, used his fists more than his words, and one day my brother just... had enough. Broke my father's ribs before we could pull him off."

Henderson's looking at the broken fence, not at me.

"I understand the rage that builds up," he continues. "When someone's been hurting you your whole life, when you've been taking it and taking it because you don't have a choice, and then one day something snaps. I understand that, Rick. I do."

He turns to look at me now, and his expression is impossible to read.

"But you can't let it control you. That's the difference between being a man and being... well. Being like your father."

The words land like a punch to the gut.

"I know," I say. My voice sounds hollow. "I know I screwed up. I know I—"

"Do you want to change?" Henderson interrupts. "Really change? Or have you just been pretending all summer?"

The question stops me cold.

"I don't..." I start, then stop. My hands are still shaking. "I thought I was changing. I thought I was getting better at controlling it. But then he showed up and I just... I lost it. I couldn't stop."

"You stopped when I pulled you off," Henderson points out.

"Yeah, but—"

"You stopped," he repeats. "You didn't fight me. You didn't keep going after I got between you. That's something."

I shake my head. "It's not enough."

"No," Henderson agrees quietly. "It's not. Not yet."

We're both quiet for a moment. Somewhere in the distance, a crow calls. The sun beats down on the farmyard, making the blood on the ground look almost black.

"I expect you to go home," Henderson finally says. "Clean yourself up. Think about what happened here today. Think about whether you really want to do the work of becoming someone different, or if you're just going to let your anger run your life."

I wait for the rest. For the "and don't come back." For the "the deal's off." For the "stay away from my daughter."

But Henderson just looks at me, waiting.

"That's it?" I finally ask.

"What did you expect?"

"I expected you to call Sheriff Webb. To press charges. To tell me I'm done here and you want me off your property."

Henderson studies me for a long moment. "Is that what you want? For me to make it easy on you? Let you off the hook so you can tell yourself you tried but it didn't work out?"

The words hit harder than my father's punches.

"No," I say.

"Then go home. Clean up. We'll talk tomorrow when you've had time to think."

"About what?"

"About whether you really want to change," Henderson says again. "Or if you're just pretending."

He walks away then, heading toward the barn to assess the damage to the fence. Leaving me standing there with blood drying on my knuckles and my father's words echoing in my head.

Exactly like me. Angry, violent, worthless.

I look down at my hands. At the blood. At the dirt. At the wreckage of the fence I spent six weeks fixing.

I should say something. Should apologize, or try to explain, or promise to fix the fence again.

But there's nothing to say.

So I turn and walk to where I parked the Chevy this morning. It feels like a lifetime ago. Like I was a different person when I pulled up here before dawn, ready to work, thinking about Claire and how her hair catches the early light.

That Rick Dalton doesn't exist anymore.

I climb into the driver's seat and my ribs scream in protest. My father got me good there. My face is throbbing too, and when I look in the rearview mirror I can see my cheek is already swelling. There's blood on my shirt. Under my fingernails. Probably in my hair.

I look like exactly what I am: a kid who just beat the hell out of his own father.

I start the engine. The familiar rumble that usually calms me down does nothing today. My hands are shaking on the wheel.

The drive home takes five minutes. Five minutes of replaying every second of that fight. Every punch. Every moment where I could've stopped and didn't. Every word my father said that was designed to make me snap.

And I snapped. Like he knew I would.

Like I always do.

I park in front of our run-down rental house and just sit there. My father's truck isn't back yet. Probably stopped at a bar to drink away what just happened. To tell anyone who'll listen how his ungrateful son attacked him for no reason. By tomorrow the whole town will know. By tomorrow Rick Dalton beating up his drunk father in the Henderson farmyard will be the only thing anyone talks about.

Sheriff Webb will probably show up. Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. Doesn't matter. I earned whatever's coming.

The worst part—the absolute worst part—isn't the physical pain or even Henderson's quiet disappointment. Isn't even the thought of facing Sheriff Webb or what the town will say.

It's knowing that Claire saw it all.

She watched me lose control. Watched me turn into exactly the violent hothead everyone's always said I was. Watched me prove that all the breathing and counting and learning control was just surface-level nonsense that disappeared the second I was really tested.

She was standing right there. Watching me become my father.

I close my eyes and I can still see her face. White. Shocked. Frozen.

Scared.

She was scared. Not of my father—of me.

I did that. I put that expression on her face.

The girl who's spent all summer teaching me to breathe through anger, who believed I could be better, who looked at me like I was someone worth knowing instead of just Frank Dalton's worthless kid—I made her scared of me.

I get out of the car and walk into the house. It's empty. Dark. Smells like stale beer and cigarettes and defeat.

I go to the bathroom and look at myself in the cracked mirror. My face is a mess. Swollen cheek, split lip, bruises already forming. Blood on my collar. Dirt in my hair.

But it's my eyes that stop me.

They look just like my father's. Angry. Bitter. Lost.

I turn on the faucet and wash my hands. The water runs pink, then red, then finally clear. But my knuckles are split open, and I know from experience they'll take weeks to heal completely.

Weeks during which I'll look down and see the evidence of what I did.

See the proof that Frank Dalton was right all along.

I'm exactly like him.

Angry. Violent. Worthless.

And I just destroyed the only good thing I've ever had.

I sit down on the edge of the bathtub and drop my head into my hands. My ribs protest the movement but I don't care. The physical pain is nothing compared to the crushing weight of what I've done.

Henderson said to think about whether I want to change.

But how do you change what you are in your blood? How do you become something different when violence and anger are all you've ever known?

I don't have an answer.

All I know is that when I close my eyes, I see Claire's face. White and shocked and scared.

And I know that no matter what Tom Henderson said about talking tomorrow, it doesn't matter.

Because I've already lost the only thing that made me want to be better in the first place.
