# Chapter 27: She Shows Up

Saturday evening I drive the Chevy to the fairgrounds. The sun's just starting to set, painting everything orange and gold. The perfect evening for a county fair. For families and cotton candy and carnival rides.

For destruction.

The parking lot is packed. Everyone in Pine Valley must be here. The demolition derby is always the biggest draw—something about watching things get destroyed speaks to people on a fundamental level.

I know the feeling.

I park at the edge of the lot and sit there for a moment with the engine idling. This is it. Last chance to change my mind. Last chance to drive away and forget this whole stupid idea.

But I don't move.

Instead I check my reflection in the rearview mirror. I look tired. Older than seventeen. The bruises from the fight with my father have mostly faded, but there's something different in my eyes now. Something harder.

Or maybe I'm just seeing what I expect to see.

I kill the engine and get out.

The fairgrounds are alive with noise—carnival music, people laughing, the smell of fried food and exhaust.

I make my way to the derby arena. It's just a big dirt lot surrounded by temporary fencing, grandstands set up on all sides. The stands are already packed.

The whole town is here to watch me destroy the car I built.

Bobby's already there, his Ford sitting in the staging area with the other derby cars. He sees me and waves me over, grinning like a maniac.

"You made it! I was starting to think you'd chicken out."

"I'm here," I say.

"Your car looks good. Almost a shame to wreck it."

Almost.

I drive the Chevy into the staging area and park next to Bobby's Ford. All around us, other guys are making last-minute checks on their cars—tightening bolts, checking tire pressure, taping over headlights.

Preparing for destruction.

Sheriff Webb is at the registration table. Of course he is. He probably volunteered just for the chance to watch Rick Dalton destroy something.

When I walk over to check in, he looks up and gives me that knowing smile. The one that says he always knew I'd end up here eventually.

"Rick Dalton," he says, like my name is a punchline. "Should've figured you'd be in the derby. Destruction's more your speed than actual construction, isn't it?"

I don't answer. Just take my number—thirteen, because of course it is—and walk back to the Chevy.

The announcer's voice crackles over the loudspeaker, welcoming everyone to the Pine Valley County Fair Demolition Derby. Explaining the rules: last car running wins, no hitting driver's side doors, if you stop moving for more than ten seconds you're out.

Simple. Brutal. Perfect.

I climb into the Chevy and strap in. The steering wheel is familiar under my hands. Everything about this car is mine—every modification, every repair, every choice that made it what it is.

And in about five minutes, it's going to start getting smashed to pieces.

My heart's pounding. Adrenaline mixing with fear and the familiar rush of knowing I'm about to do something reckless and exactly what everyone expects from Rick Dalton.

The other drivers are getting into their cars. Engines roaring to life all around me. The crowd in the stands is getting louder, excited, ready for the show.

I turn the key. The Chevy's engine catches immediately—because of course it does, because I maintain it perfectly, because this car has never let me down.

And I'm about to let it get destroyed.

The announcer is doing introductions now. Calling out each driver by name, getting the crowd worked up. When he gets to me—"Rick Dalton in number thirteen!"—there's a mix of cheers and boos. The Dalton name gets that reaction. Some people love the troublemaker. Others just want to see him fail.

Tonight they'll get both.

I rev the engine. Feel the power underneath the hood. Two years of work, of learning, of building something from nothing. Two years of proving I could create instead of just destroy.

All about to end.

The official raises the green flag.

This is it.

Then I see her.

Claire, pushing through the crowd at the fence. Her face urgent, scared. She's waving at me, trying to get my attention over the noise of twenty engines and a crowd of hundreds.

My heart drops into my stomach.

No. She's not supposed to be here. She's supposed to be safe at home, not seeing this, not watching me destroy everything I've built because I don't know how else to prove I've changed.

But she's here. And she's shouting something I can't hear over the engines.

I look at the official. At the green flag. At Bobby in his car, grinning and ready to go.

Then I look back at Claire.

And I unbuckle my seatbelt.

"What are you doing?" Bobby yells from his car.

The official is blowing his whistle, waving at me. "Driver thirteen, you need to buckle in!"

But I'm already out of the car, already moving toward the fence where Claire's standing.

The crowd's murmuring now. Confused. Is this part of the show?

I reach the fence. Claire's on the other side, her hands gripping the chain-link, her face flushed from pushing through the crowd.

"What are you doing?" she asks, breathless.

"I'm in the derby," I say stupidly.

"I can see that." She's looking at me like I'm crazy. Like I'm about to do something incredibly stupid. "Why?"

"I'm wrecking the car. Moving on. Ending the chapter." The words sound hollow even to me. "Starting fresh."

Claire's expression shifts from confused to understanding to something like anger.

"You're destroying it," she says. "The car you built."

"Yeah."

"Why?"

"Because..." I trail off. Because I don't know how to explain it. Because it seemed symbolic. Because I'm scared. Because I don't know who I am if I'm not the angry kid with the hot rod.

Because it was easier than actually figuring out how to change.

Claire's looking at me with those steady eyes that see right through all my walls.

"Don't destroy something you built just because you're scared, Rick."

The words hit me like a punch.

"I'm not—"

"Yes you are." Her voice is firm. "You're scared that you haven't really changed. Scared that the summer was just pretending. Scared that you're still going to end up like your father no matter what you do. So you're going to wreck this car because destroying things is familiar. It's safe. It's what everyone expects."

Behind me, the announcer is saying something about a delay. The crowd's getting restless.

But all I can see is Claire.

"You spent two years building this car from scrap metal," she continues. "Two years learning and failing and trying again until you got it right. This car is proof that you can create something good. That you can take something broken and make it whole."

She squeezes the fence, leaning closer.

"And you're about to destroy it because you're too scared to believe you can do the same thing with yourself."

"It's just a car," I say, but the words are weak.

"No it's not. It's everything you're capable of when you don't give up. Everything you are when you choose to build instead of destroy. And if you wreck it tonight, you're proving to yourself that Bobby was right—that you're still just the old Rick Dalton who solves everything with destruction."

My chest is tight. The adrenaline that felt like excitement a minute ago feels like panic now.

"You're better than that," Claire says quietly. "You know you are. You've spent all summer proving it."

I turn and look at the Chevy. At the cherry red paint that I spent hours sanding and coating. At the engine I built piece by piece. At the car that's been my one constant for two years.

The car that represents every hour I spent learning to be better at something. Every failure I pushed through. Every moment I chose to keep trying instead of giving up.

I built that.

And I was about to destroy it because I'm scared that I can't build myself the same way.

"Rick." Claire's voice pulls me back. "You can walk away. You can get in that car and drive it home and remember that you're someone who builds things, not someone who destroys them."

The official is approaching. "Driver thirteen, you need to make a decision. You in or out?"

I look at Claire. At her face, determined and certain and believing in me even when I don't believe in myself.

Then I look at the Chevy.

Then back at the official.

"I'm out," I hear myself say.

"What?" Bobby's leaning out of his car window. "Rick, what are you doing?"

The crowd's murmuring louder now. Sheriff Webb is shaking his head.

But I don't care.

I'm walking back to the Chevy to drive it out of here.

"You're crazy!" Bobby yells. "This is your chance! Everyone's watching!"

"I know," I say.

And I do know. The whole town is watching Rick Dalton walk away from destruction. Walk away from the reckless, angry kid they all know.

Watching me choose something different.

I climb into the Chevy and start the engine. The official is waving me out of the arena, annoyed, ready to get on with the show.

I drive slowly out of the staging area, past the grandstands full of confused spectators, past Sheriff Webb shaking his head, past Bobby who's staring at me like I've lost my mind.

Maybe I have.

But for the first time in days, the numbness in my chest is gone.

I park in the lot and Claire's already there, having run from the fence.

I get out and just stand there, heart pounding, hands shaking on the keys.

"I was going to destroy it," I say.

"I know."

"I was going to wreck it because I thought that would prove I've changed. That I'm done with the old Rick Dalton."

"But?" Claire prompts gently.

"But you're right." I look at the Chevy. At the car I built. "This isn't the old Rick Dalton. This is proof that I can create something good. That I don't have to destroy things."

I turn to face her.

"I don't have to destroy myself either."

Claire smiles. "No. You don't."

And standing there in the fairgrounds parking lot with the sounds of the demolition derby starting behind us, I feel something I haven't felt in a long time.

Relief.

I didn't destroy it. Didn't give in to the fear. Didn't prove everyone right about what a Dalton really is.

I chose something different.

And that has to mean something.

That has to mean I'm changing for real.
