# Chapter 15: What He Wants

Early August, and the heat is brutal.

We're clearing the main irrigation ditch—hot, muddy work that has to be done before the August rains. Claire and I are waist-deep in muck, shoveling debris and silt. Sweat drips into my eyes. My shirt plastered to my back. The sun beats down relentlessly.

But I'm here. Showing up. Doing the work.

Claire's a few feet away, working just as hard. Her braid coming loose, mud spattered across her face, but she doesn't complain. Just keeps shoveling, steady like always.

"Almost done with this section," she says. "Then we can take a break."

"Thank God. I'm melting."

"You're not melting. You're just soft from living in town."

"I've been working on this farm for seven weeks."

Claire glances at me, amusement in her eyes. "Seven weeks. Out of how many years?"

"My life has never been easy."

Her expression softens. "No. I suppose it hasn't. Sorry."

We work in silence, finishing the worst of the silt. When we finally climb out, we're both covered head to toe in mud.

"You look like you fell in," I say.

"You look worse."

We walk to the water pump and rinse off the worst of the mud. The cold water feels amazing. Claire pulls the tie from her braid and shakes her hair loose, and I have to look away.

We settle under the oak tree, drinking water. The shade helps, but the August heat is relentless.

"So," Claire says. "What are you going to do after graduation?"

The question catches me off guard.

"Why do you want to know?"

"Just curious. Nine months from now, you'll be done with school. Done here. Free to do whatever you want." She takes a drink. "So what do you want?"

I think about the answer I gave Bobby. Detroit. Working in a garage. Starting over where nobody knows my name.

But that answer doesn't feel right anymore.

"I've been thinking," I say slowly. "Maybe I don't want to leave after all."

Claire looks at me, surprised. "Leave Pine Valley?"

"Yeah. I always thought I'd get out as soon as I could. Go somewhere nobody knows I'm Frank Dalton's kid. Start fresh." I set down my cup. "But lately I've been wondering if running away is really starting fresh, or if it's just... running."

"What changed?"

Everything. You. This summer. The way you see me as capable of being better.

"The work here, I guess," I say instead. "It's been good. Fixing things instead of breaking them. It feels better than I expected."

"So you'd stay in Pine Valley? Do what?"

"Maybe work at Henderson's garage full-time. Save money. Eventually get my own place." The idea forms as I say it. "Build engines, restore cars. It's not Detroit, but it's something."

"It's more than something. It's a life. A real plan."

"Yeah, well. Plans can change."

Claire is watching me. "What really changed, Rick? Two months ago you were counting down days. Now you're talking about staying."

This is it. The moment where I could tell her the truth.

That she changed everything. That working beside her showed me what I want isn't escape—it's this. The steady rhythm of work that matters. Building instead of tearing apart. The calm that comes from being around someone who sees the best version of you.

That I want to stay because she's here, and the idea of being somewhere she's not makes Detroit feel like the emptiest place in the world.

That I'm falling for her, have been falling for weeks, and staying means maybe—just maybe—there could be something more.

But saying it makes it real. Makes me vulnerable. Opens me up to rejection and confirmation that Claire Henderson is too good for Frank Dalton's kid.

So instead I say, "The farm work's been good for me. Made me realize I don't have to keep running. Maybe I can just be Rick Dalton, the guy who's good with engines, instead of Frank Dalton's kid or the hothead who crashed a car."

"That's why you'd stay? Because of farm work?"

She's looking at me like she knows I'm not telling the whole truth. Like she can see right through the careful answer to what I'm not saying.

"That's part of it," I admit.

"What's the rest?"

I can't answer. Can't make myself say it.

Claire is quiet, then says softly, "You don't have to tell me. But Rick? Whatever the reason is, I hope it makes you happy. Not just something you think you should do."

"What if I don't know the difference?"

"Then you figure it out. One day at a time."

She stands, brushing dirt off her jeans. "We should get back to work. Another section to clear."

I watch her walk back toward the ditch, and everything in me wants to call her back. Tell her the truth—that she's the reason I want to stay. That she became more important than escape plans. That I wake up every morning wanting to see her.

But I don't call her back.

Because there's no version of this that ends well. Claire's going places—college, if she can convince her father, or running this farm better than anyone. She's got dreams and a future that doesn't include the town troublemaker.

And I'm just the kid who crashed through her fence. The project she fixed, like the irrigation system.

Telling her would only complicate things. Make the rest of summer awkward. Ruin the friendship we've built.

I can't do that.

So I stand up and follow Claire back to the ditch. We work side by side for another hour, and the whole time I'm hyperaware of how close she is. How easy it would be to reach over, take her hand, tell her what I'm thinking.

But I don't.

Around noon, Tom Henderson calls from the farmhouse. We climb out of the ditch, rinse off at the pump, and head toward the house.

Claire walks slightly ahead, and I watch the way she moves through the farm—confident, comfortable, at home. This is her place. Her land.

And I realize with sudden clarity that I'm in love with her.

Not just falling. Not just interested or attracted or whatever I've been telling myself.

Actually in love.

With the way she handles problems calmly. With the way she asks what I'm really angry about instead of just reacting. With the way she sees me as capable of being better and refuses to accept less.

With the way she loves this farm. With her passion for soil science. With her quiet determination to prove she can run this place.

With the way she laughs at my jokes. With the way she packs extra lunch. With the way she looks at me sometimes like maybe I'm not completely hopeless.

I'm in love with Claire Henderson, and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it.

Because she deserves better than me. Deserves someone who's going somewhere, who has his life together, who can give her everything she wants without dragging her down.

And I'm none of those things.

I'm Frank Dalton's kid with anger issues and a reputation. I'm the guy who works with his hands because book learning never stuck. I'm someone who's spent his whole life trying not to become his father and isn't entirely sure he's succeeded.

Claire deserves better.

But that doesn't stop me from wanting her.

Doesn't stop me from thinking about what it would be like if she felt the same way. If maybe we could build something together—her running this farm with modern techniques, me working in a garage restoring engines, both of us proving we're more than what this town expects.

It's a nice dream.

Stupid, impossible, but nice.

We reach the farmhouse and Mrs. Henderson has lunch ready. We eat at the kitchen table—me, Claire, Tom Henderson, Mrs. Henderson. Like I'm part of the family instead of hired labor.

I don't belong here. Know I don't. But God, I wish I did.

After lunch, we head back out to finish the irrigation work. The afternoon is even hotter than the morning, and by the time we call it a day around six, I'm exhausted, covered in mud again, and trying not to think too hard about the fact that summer is running out.

Seven weeks down. Roughly five more to go before my obligation is done.

Five more weeks of working beside Claire. Five more weeks of pretending I don't feel what I feel. Five more weeks before I have to figure out whether staying in Pine Valley is brave or just another kind of running away.

"Same time Monday?" Claire asks as I'm heading to the Chevy.

"Same time Monday."

She smiles, and my chest does that tight, warm thing it's been doing lately whenever she looks at me.

I drive home thinking about irrigation ditches and muddy work and Claire asking what changed my mind about leaving.

Thinking about all the things I didn't say.

All the things I can't say.

All the things I want more than I've ever wanted anything.

I want to stay in Pine Valley. Want to build a life here. Want to wake up every morning and drive to the Henderson farm and work beside Claire doing whatever needs doing.

Want to be the person she sees when she looks at me—someone capable, someone steady, someone worth believing in.

Want her.

Simple as that. Complicated as that.

I want Claire Henderson, and I can't have her, and knowing that doesn't make me want her any less.

So I'll take what I can get. Five more weeks of working beside her. Five more weeks of making her laugh and listening to her talk about soil science. Five more weeks of being near her.

And when summer ends, when my obligation is done and we go back to our separate lives, maybe the wanting will fade.

Maybe I'll be able to look at her in town or at school and not feel my chest tighten.

Maybe I'll be able to move on.

But I don't believe that.

Because some things, once you have them, you can't go back to not having. And Claire Henderson's friendship, her trust, her belief that I can be better—that's something I'll carry with me whether we're working together or not.

Even if I never tell her how I feel.

Even if this goes nowhere.

She changed me.

Made me want to be steady instead of destructive. Made me want to build instead of run. Made me want to stay instead of leave.

Made me want to be worthy of her, even if I never will be.

And that's enough.

It has to be.

Because it's all I'm going to get.
