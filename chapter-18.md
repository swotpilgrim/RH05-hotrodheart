# Chapter 18: Frank Dalton Shows Up

Wednesday starts normal. Normal as in Claire and I are working on reinforcing the barn door that's been hanging crooked since before I started working here. Normal as in I show up before dawn, we work in comfortable silence until the sun gets high enough to make us sweat, and somewhere around mid-morning Claire's mother brings us lemonade and sandwiches. Normal as in I'm not thinking about anything except getting this door hung straight so it'll actually close properly when winter comes.

I should've known better. Nothing in my life stays normal for long.

I'm holding the door in place while Claire marks where the new hinges need to go when I hear the truck. Old engine, missing badly, exhaust rattling like something's about to fall off. I know that sound. I've been hearing it my whole life—coming home late at night, leaving early in the morning when there's still money for the bar, sitting idle in our driveway for days when there's not.

My whole body goes tense. Every muscle locks up like I've been hit with ice water.

"You okay?" Claire asks, looking up from where she's kneeling with the pencil.

The concern in her voice makes my chest tight. She doesn't know. Doesn't know what that sound means, what's about to walk into this perfect summer morning and destroy everything.

"Yeah," I lie.

But I'm not okay, because that truck is pulling into the Henderson farmyard right now, and when I turn around, I see exactly what I was afraid I'd see.

My father's truck—a piece of junk held together with rust and bad decisions—lurches to a stop near the barn. The driver's door opens, and Frank Dalton stumbles out.

He's drunk.

Of course he's drunk. It's barely noon on a Wednesday, and my father is drunk enough that he's having trouble standing straight.

"Rick!" he yells, his voice slurred and too loud. "Rick, you out here?"

I let go of the barn door carefully, like if I move too fast everything will shatter. Claire's watching me, her expression unreadable, but I can feel her concern like a physical weight.

"Stay here," I tell her quietly.

"Rick—"

"Please. Just stay here."

I walk toward my father, my hands already clenching into fists at my sides. Every step feels like I'm walking through mud. Breathe, I tell myself. Count to ten. Don't let him get to you. You've been doing so well. Don't let him ruin it.

But it's hard to breathe when your worst nightmare is stumbling across the Henderson farmyard in broad daylight. Hard to count when all you can think about is every person in Pine Valley hearing about this by sundown. Hard to stay calm when the one thing you've been terrified of all summer is happening right in front of you.

My father. Drunk. Here. Destroying everything.

"There he is," my father says when he sees me, spreading his arms wide like we're old friends. "My boy. My son the farmer."

He reeks of whiskey. The smell hits me from ten feet away, sour and familiar and nauseating.

"You need to leave," I say, keeping my voice level.

"Leave?" He laughs, nearly loses his balance, catches himself against the truck. "I just got here. Came to see where my boy's been spending all his time. Working for the Hendersons like some kind of..." He waves his hand vaguely. "Some kind of pet."

The word hits me like a slap. "I'm working to pay off what I owe. That's all."

"That's all," he mimics in a high-pitched voice that makes me want to punch him. "Listen to you. So respectful. So responsible. Think you're better than where you came from now?"

"I think you should leave before—"

"Before what?" He pushes off the truck, takes a stumbling step toward me. "Before I embarrass you? Before the Hendersons see what kind of family you really come from?"

"They already know what kind of family I come from," I say through clenched teeth.

The farmhouse door opens, and Tom Henderson steps out onto the porch. He takes one look at the situation and starts walking toward us, his face set.

"Mr. Dalton," he says, his voice calm but firm. "I'm going to have to ask you to leave my property."

My father turns to face Henderson, and for a second I think he might actually listen. But then he laughs—that bitter, ugly laugh I've heard a thousand times before.

"Your property," he says. "Right. Your property, your farm, your fancy fence that my boy's been fixing all summer. You know what I think, Henderson? I think you're using him. Getting cheap labor out of a kid who didn't have any choice."

"That's not true, and you know it," Henderson says. "Rick's been working here as part of an agreement we made. He's been doing good work, and he's kept his word."

"His word." My father spits on the ground. "A Dalton's word. That's rich."

I can feel my control starting to slip. The anger that I've been learning to manage, to breathe through, to count away—it's rising in my chest like flood water. My vision's starting to go red at the edges.

Ten. Nine. Eight.

"Rick's not your concern anymore, Mr. Dalton," Henderson is saying. "I'm asking you politely to leave. Don't make me call Sheriff Webb."

"Webb," my father scoffs. "Yeah, you do that. Call Webb. He already knows what we are. What Rick is. You can dress him up in farm clothes and put him to work in the sun, but underneath he's still a Dalton. Still got that anger in him, just like me. Just like his mother before she ran off because she couldn't stand us anymore."

Seven. Six. Five.

My hands are shaking.

"Rick's not like you," Henderson says quietly.

"You sure about that?" My father's looking at me now, his eyes bloodshot and mean. "Look at him. Look at those fists. He wants to hit me so bad he's shaking with it. That's my boy. That's a Dalton through and through."

Four. Three.

"Mr. Dalton, you need to leave. Now."

But my father's not done. He turns toward the barn, and that's when he sees Claire standing there, watching. His face twists into something ugly.

"Well, well," he says. "That's what this is about."

Two.

"Don't," I say, my voice barely human.

"Working all summer on this farm. Playing the good boy. And all along you've been sniffing around the Henderson girl."

One.

"I said don't."

But he's walking toward Claire now, stumbling but moving, and every instinct I have is screaming at me to get between them. To protect her. To keep his poison away from the one good thing in my life.

"She's pretty," my father says, loud enough that Claire can hear every word. "I get it. Rich girl, respectable family. Respectable. Not like us, right Rick? Think if you work hard enough, Henderson here might let you have her? Think she'll make you into something you're not?"

I'm moving before I realize it, putting myself between my father and Claire. I can feel her behind me, can feel the heat radiating off the barn in the August sun, can hear Tom Henderson saying something sharp and angry.

But all I can focus on is my father. On keeping him away from her. On making sure his ugliness doesn't touch her.

"Get back in your truck," I say. "Get back in your truck and leave."

"Or what?" He's in my face now, breathing whiskey fumes. "You gonna hit me? Gonna show the pretty girl what you really are?"

Behind me, I hear Claire say my name. Soft, like a reminder. Like she's trying to reach through the red haze filling my vision. Like she believes I can still walk away from this.

I'm trying. God, I'm trying so hard to hold it together. To breathe. To count. To be the person I've been working all summer to become. To prove that I'm not him, that I'm not just Frank Dalton's son destined to repeat every mistake he's ever made.

But then my father looks past me at Claire and smiles. It's not a nice smile. It's the smile of a man who knows exactly where to hit to make it hurt the most.

"You screwing her?" he asks, loud enough that the words echo across the farmyard. "That why you're playing farmer all summer? Getting something sweet on the side?"

I hear Tom Henderson shout something. Hear Claire gasp.

And then I feel my father's hand on my shoulder—not gentle, rough and mocking—and he shoves me.

"That's it, isn't it?" he says. "My boy's finally getting—"

I snap.

I shove him back, hard. He stumbles, almost falls, catches himself.

And just like that, all the progress I've made—all the breathing and counting and learning to control the anger that's been eating me alive since I was old enough to understand what my father was—it's gone.

Everything I've worked for this summer, every fence I've fixed, every moment of calm I've found with Claire beside me, every single reason I had to believe I could be something other than Frank Dalton's son—

It evaporates.

Because I'm standing in the Henderson farmyard with my fists clenched and my father in front of me, and all I can think about is making him hurt the way he's been hurting me my entire life.

"Come on then," my father says, straightening up. There's blood on his lip from where he bit it when I shoved him. "Show them what you really are."

And God help me, I'm about to do exactly that.
