# Chapter 2: Consequences in Daylight

I wake up to sunlight stabbing through thin curtains in my bedroom and the immediate, crushing knowledge that last night really happened.

For about three seconds, I let myself hope it was a bad dream. Then I turn my head and see my clothes from last night thrown on the floor, dirt still clinging to them, and I know better. My body aches—shoulders tight, neck stiff from the crash. When I sit up, my hands are sore from gripping the steering wheel like it could save me.

It didn't.

The house is quiet except for the familiar sound of my father snoring in the living room. Same place he was when I left last night. Probably hasn't moved except maybe to grab another bottle. I swing my legs out of bed, feet hitting the worn wooden floor that's cold despite the June morning.

My room's small—just a bed, a dresser with a busted drawer, and my clothes. Not much to look at, but it's mine. Better than the rest of this place, anyway.

I pull on clean jeans and a t-shirt, trying not to think about what I have to do this morning. But there's no avoiding it. I have to go back to the Henderson farm in daylight and see exactly what I destroyed.

In the living room, my father's sprawled on the couch like a corpse. Empty bottles scattered around him. The whole room smells like stale beer and failure. Work shirt from the mill still on, stained and wrinkled. One arm hanging off the couch, mouth open, snoring.

I stand there for a minute, feeling that familiar mix of rage and something worse. Frank Dalton, forty-three years old and this is all he's got. This is all I've got.

I grab my keys and head outside.

The Chevy's parked in our driveway, and in morning light the damage looks worse. Front end dented, one headlight cracked, chrome bent. This car was perfect yesterday. I made it perfect.

Now it's just another thing I broke.

I climb in and turn the key. The engine fires up—faithful, reliable—and I back out onto Maple Street. Our house looks even worse in daylight. Peeling paint, crooked shutters, broken porch steps. Everyone who drives past knows this is where Frank Dalton lives.

The drive to the Henderson farm takes fifteen minutes. I've passed it a hundred times racing these roads, never been on the property. The Hendersons don't mix with families like mine. They're respectable.

I turn onto the dirt drive, stomach tightening with every foot. Fields stretch out on both sides. Everything neat and well-tended. The kind of place that takes work and care.

The kind of place I just destroyed.

The farmhouse comes into view—two stories, white with black shutters. Solid. Real. There's a barn behind it, and beyond that I can see the fence line.

Or where it used to be.

I park and kill the engine. Through the windshield I can see the damage. Thirty feet of fence gone. White rails scattered like broken teeth.

And the garden.

I force myself out. Walk toward the destruction, each step heavier than the last.

In daylight, it's so much worse.

The fence is obliterated. Posts snapped, rails splintered. My tire tracks cut through what used to be neat rows of vegetables. Plants crushed, dirt churned up. Everything ruined.

This wasn't an accident. This was me being exactly what everyone thinks I am.

"Quite a mess, isn't it?"

I spin around. Tom Henderson is standing ten feet away. Big guy, late forties, work clothes and boots. His face weathered from years of farm work. Eyes steady, assessing.

Next to him is a girl about my age. Dark hair in a ponytail, jeans and work shirt. Watching me with the same steady look. This must be Claire. The one whose garden I destroyed.

"Mr. Henderson," I manage. "I'm Rick Dalton. This was me. Last night."

"I figured." Henderson walks closer, looking at the fence. "Sheriff Webb came by this morning. Tommy Briggs' father called him. Tommy told Webb it was your Chevy."

My heart drops. "Is the sheriff coming back?"

"Probably." Henderson picks up a broken rail. "Reckless driving, destruction of property, illegal racing. That's what Webb says he'll charge you with."

Charges mean court. Court means a record. A record means I'm done—no job, no future. Following my father's footsteps to nowhere.

"I'll pay for it," I say, though I have no idea how. "I'll fix it. Whatever it takes."

Henderson looks at me for a long moment. "You got insurance on that car?"

"No, sir."

"Money to pay for this?"

"No, sir."

"Criminal record already?"

"No, sir." Not yet.

Henderson nods slowly. Behind him, Claire hasn't said a word. Just watches with calm eyes. Her face gives nothing away.

"Sheriff Webb wants to press charges," Henderson says. "You earned them. Serious damage. That fence alone will cost two hundred dollars, and the garden my daughter spent six weeks planting is destroyed."

I look at Claire. Six weeks of work, gone because I couldn't keep control for one night.

"I'm sorry," I say to her. Pathetic, inadequate. But it's all I've got.

She doesn't respond.

Henderson walks to the garden, picks up a crushed tomato plant. "My daughter put a lot of work into this."

"I know."

"You work, Rick?"

The question catches me off guard. "Yes, sir. Part-time at Murphy's garage."

"You good at it?"

"I rebuilt that Chevy myself," I say, pointing at my car. "From scrap. Took two years."

Henderson looks at the Chevy, at the damage. "So you can fix things when you want to."

"Yes, sir."

He's quiet for a minute. I can hear birds singing somewhere. The sun's getting higher, warming the air.

"I've been thinking since Webb came by," Henderson finally says. "My first instinct was to let the law handle it. You destroyed my property, you should face consequences."

"Yes, sir."

"But then I thought about it more." He brushes dirt off his hands. "I know your father, Rick. Know the situation you're living in."

The shame burns hot. Of course he knows. Everyone knows about Frank Dalton.

"I also know," Henderson continues, "that sending you through the legal system might be justice, but it won't fix my fence or my daughter's garden. And it won't help you."

Henderson looks at Claire, then back at me. "So here's what I'm thinking. You work off the debt. All summer, six days a week, dawn to dusk. You mend every bit of fence on this property—and there's a lot more than just this section. You replant the garden. You do whatever work I need."

I stare at him. "You're offering me a job?"

"I'm offering you a choice," he corrects. "Take the legal consequences—Webb presses charges, you go to court, probably get a record and community service. Or you work off your debt to me directly. Complete the summer without incident, showing up on time and sober every day, and I'll consider us even. I'll tell Webb I don't want to press charges."

It's not really a choice.

But something about the way he's looking at me makes me stand up straighter.

"I'll do it," I say. "The work. Whatever you need."

"Every day. Dawn to dusk. Six days a week."

"Yes, sir."

"And if you show up drunk, or don't show up at all, or give me any reason to think you're not taking this seriously, the deal's off and I call Webb myself."

"I understand."

He studies me. "Can you commit to that, Rick? Showing up sober and on time every day?"

The question stings. Can I commit to not being my father?

"Yes, sir," I say firmly. "I can."

Henderson nods. "All right. You start Monday morning, six AM. My daughter Claire will supervise your work, tell you what needs doing. Since it's her garden you destroyed, she'll decide when it's properly fixed."

I look at Claire again. Still watching with that unreadable expression. Spending my whole summer under the watch of some farm girl who probably hates my guts.

"Monday morning," I repeat. "I'll be here."

"See that you are." Henderson picks up another piece of broken fence. "You can go now."

I nod, back toward my Chevy. Claire still hasn't said a single word. Just watches as I get in and start the engine.

As I pull away, I look in the rearview. Tom Henderson is examining the fence, calculating the work. Claire is still standing there, arms crossed, watching my car disappear.

The whole way home, I try to figure out if I just got the luckiest break of my life or sentenced myself to the worst summer imaginable.

Probably both.

At least it's not jail. At least I've got one chance to prove I'm not completely worthless.

I just have to spend the entire summer working for people who have every reason to look down on me, supervised by a girl who watched me destroy something she spent six weeks building.

Yeah. This is going to be hell.
