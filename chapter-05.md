# Chapter 5: Testing the Waters

By the end of the first week, I'm sore in muscles I didn't know I had.

Every morning my back screams at me. My shoulders feel like someone's been hitting them with a hammer. My hands are covered in blisters that have popped and reformed. Even getting out of bed is an exercise in pain.

But I show up at the Henderson farm every morning at six AM anyway.

Because I made a deal. Because the alternative is Sheriff Webb and a criminal record.

But that doesn't mean I have to like it.

Monday was fence clearing. Tuesday through Thursday we dug postholes for new fence posts—backbreaking work that had me sweating by seven and wanting to quit by noon. Claire worked beside me the whole time, calm and steady, showing me where to dig, how deep, how to make sure they're plumb.

She never gets tired. Never complains. Just works.

And for some reason, that drives me crazy.

Friday morning, I decide to test something. I wake up at my usual time but take my time. Eat a slow breakfast. Check the Chevy's oil though it doesn't need it. Waste fifteen minutes doing nothing.

I pull up to the Henderson farm at six-twenty.

Claire's already working. She's got a fence post set in one of yesterday's holes, using a level to make sure it's straight. She glances up when she hears the Chevy, notes the time, then goes right back to work.

No lecture. No annoyance. Nothing.

I grab my tools and walk over. "Sorry I'm late."

"Are you?" she asks, not looking up.

"What?"

"Sorry." She adjusts the post slightly. "Because if you're actually sorry, you won't do it again."

I don't have an answer.

"Hold this steady while I pack dirt around the base," she says.

I hold it, and we work in silence for twenty minutes getting the post set. When it's done, Claire steps back, examines it, nods.

"Good. Next one."

That's it. No yelling. No threatening to tell her father. Just moving on like my being late didn't matter at all.

It's infuriating.

By mid-morning, I'm looking for other ways to get a reaction. The calm, unshakeable way she handles everything makes me want to see if there's anything that'll crack that exterior.

We're digging another posthole—the ground here is hard, full of rocks—and I make a show of working slowly. Dragging my feet. Taking breaks even though I don't need to.

Claire just keeps working at her usual pace. Doesn't tell me to work faster. Doesn't say anything.

"You know, this is pretty boring work," I say, leaning on my shovel. "Don't you ever get tired of just digging holes in the dirt?"

"Yes," Claire says, scooping out another shovelful.

"So why do you do it?"

"Because it needs doing."

I wait for her to elaborate. She doesn't.

"That's it? Because it needs doing? That's the whole reason you spend your life on a farm in the middle of nowhere?"

"This is where I live," she says, not looking at me. "This is my family's farm. The work needs doing, so I do it. Same as you're doing it now, except I'm not complaining every five minutes."

"I'm not complaining."

"You're leaning on a shovel asking philosophical questions instead of working. Sounds like complaining to me."

Fair point.

I go back to digging, but I'm not done testing yet.

At lunch, Claire unpacks her lunchbox under the oak tree. I sit down and make a comment about how farm girls probably think this is exciting—sandwiches and lemonade in the dirt.

"Do you?" she asks.

"Do I what?"

"Think it's exciting. You're eating the same sandwich."

"I'm not doing it by choice."

"No, you're doing it because you made a bad choice and now you're paying for it." Claire takes a bite. "But you could make it less miserable by not fighting it."

"I'm not fighting it."

She gives me a look that says she knows exactly what I'm doing, and I look away first.

The afternoon is more of the same. I work slower than I could. Make sarcastic comments. Claire responds mildly or doesn't respond at all, just keeps working.

Nothing I do gets a rise out of her.

By Friday afternoon, my frustration has built to a simmer. We're in the tool shed—organizing supplies, checking inventory. It's mindless, boring work, and I'm hot and tired and my hands hurt.

"Hand me that box of nails," Claire says.

I grab it and hand it over. She examines the contents, makes a note.

"Other box. The larger ones."

I grab it, hand it over.

"This is riveting stuff," I mutter. "Really using my potential here."

"You destroyed a fence and a garden," Claire says without looking up. "Did you think the punishment would be exciting?"

"I think the punishment is designed to be as boring and degrading as possible."

"It's farm work, Rick. This is what I do every day. If it's degrading to you, what does that say about me?"

She's right, which just makes me angrier.

"Pass me the wire cutters."

I look around the shed. About fifteen different tools hang on the pegboard. "Which ones?"

"Right there." She points without looking. "Red handles."

I grab them, hand them over.

"Now the—"

"You know what?" I set down the box I'm holding harder than necessary. "This is ridiculous. I'm not your servant. I don't have to jump every time you say hand me something."

Claire looks up. "You're right. You don't have to. You could leave right now, and I could call my father, and he could call Sheriff Webb. That's your choice."

I glare at her. She looks back, calm.

"But if you stay," she continues, "you work. That was the deal. Right now, the work is organizing this shed. So either help or leave."

The rational part of my brain knows she's right. Knows I'm being an ass. Knows I should just shut up and work.

But the angry part—fed by sore muscles and blistered hands and constant humiliation—doesn't care about rational.

"Fine," I snap, and grab the next box with more force than necessary.

It's heavier than I expected. My grip slips. The box tumbles, hits the ground, spills its contents everywhere.

Nails. Hundreds of them, scattering across the shed floor in a metallic cascade.

For a second, neither of us moves.

Then I lose it.

"Damn it!" I kick the empty box, sending it skittering across the floor. "This is—I can't—"

I grab the toolbox sitting on the workbench and throw it. Not at Claire, not at anything specific. Just throw it out of pure frustration. It hits the ground and bursts open, tools scattering everywhere. Wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers, all clattering across the wooden floor.

I stand there breathing hard, fists clenched, waiting for Claire to yell. To tell me I'm done, that I'm exactly the hothead everyone thinks I am, that she's calling her father right now.

But she doesn't yell.

She just stands there, holding her clipboard, watching me with that same calm expression.

"You done?" she asks quietly.

"What?"

"Are you done?" she repeats. "With whatever this is?"

I don't answer. Don't know what to say.

Claire sets her clipboard down on the workbench. "You want me to fire you, don't you?"

The question catches me completely off guard.

"That's what this whole week has been about," she continues. "Showing up late. Working slow. Making sarcastic comments. And now this." She gestures at the scattered tools and nails covering the floor. "You're trying to get me to tell you you're done, that you can leave."

"I'm not—"

"Yes, you are." Claire crosses her arms. "Because if I fire you, then it's my fault. Then you can tell yourself it wasn't your fault things didn't work out, that you tried but the Henderson girl was impossible to work for. Then you don't have to feel guilty about breaking the deal."

My jaw tightens. "You don't know what you're talking about."

"Don't I?" She looks at me steadily. "You made a deal, Rick. Summer of work in exchange for no criminal record. You knew what you were agreeing to. But now that it's hard, now that you're actually having to do it, you want out. You just don't want to be the one who quits."

Every word hits like a punch because she's right. About all of it.

I look away, staring at the mess I just made. Nails and tools everywhere. One more thing I broke because I couldn't control my temper.

"I'm not going to fire you," Claire says firmly. "You made a deal and you're going to keep it. You're going to show up every day, you're going to work, and you're going to finish what you started. Because that's what people do when they make a commitment."

"Even if I don't want to be here?"

"Especially then." She picks up a wrench from the floor, sets it on the workbench. "Doing the right thing when you want to is easy. Doing it when you don't want to is what actually matters."

I stand there for a long moment, her words sinking in. Around us, the shed is a disaster. Tools and nails everywhere. All because I couldn't keep my anger in check for five more minutes.

"Now pick up the tools," Claire says. Not angry. Not disappointed. Just... matter-of-fact.

"What?"

"Pick them up. All of them. Sort them back into the toolbox properly. Then pick up every single nail and put them back in the box. And while you're doing that, figure out if you're going to keep acting like a child who didn't get his way, or if you're going to accept that you screwed up and now you're paying for it."

She picks up her clipboard and walks toward the shed door.

"I'll be back in twenty minutes," she says over her shoulder. "When I come back, this shed better be clean and you better have an answer about which person you're going to be."

Then she's gone, leaving me standing alone in the middle of the mess I made.

I look at the scattered tools. The nails covering the floor. The overturned toolbox.

All of it my fault. Again.

With a sigh that feels like it comes from somewhere deep in my chest, I kneel down and start picking up wrenches.

One by one.

Taking responsibility.

Like I should have done from the start.
