# Chapter 21: The Crisis

I don't sleep.

Can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see it all over again. The fight. The blood. Claire's face, white and frozen. My father's smile as he told me I'm exactly like him.

I lie on my bed in the darkness and listen to my father come home around two in the morning. Hear him stumble through the front door, knock something over, curse loudly enough to wake the neighbors. Hear him collapse onto the couch and start snoring within minutes.

He's fine. Of course he's fine. Frank Dalton's had worse beatings in bar fights and been right back at it the next night.

But I'm not fine.

I stare at the ceiling and replay every second. Every punch. Every moment where I could've stopped and didn't. Every word Henderson said afterward.

*Do you want to change? Really change? Or have you just been pretending all summer?*

I thought I was changing. Thought I was learning to control the anger, to breathe through it, to be someone different from my father.

But one moment—one drunk father showing up and saying the exact wrong things—and it all disappeared.

All that progress, all that careful control, all those mornings showing up at the Henderson farm before dawn and working until dusk, all those conversations with Claire where she taught me to count to ten and breathe—

None of it mattered.

When it counted, when I was really tested, I failed.

I proved my father right.

The thought circles my brain like a vulture, around and around and around.

*You're exactly like me. Angry, violent, worthless.*

Around midnight I get up and go to the bathroom, splash cold water on my face. The swelling has gotten worse. My whole cheek is purple now, my lip split and puffy. I look like I've been in a bar fight.

I look like my father.

Back in bed, I stare at the ceiling some more. Watch the shadows shift as clouds pass in front of the moon. Count the hours until dawn.

One. Two. Three. Four.

By the time my alarm goes off at five, I've convinced myself that Henderson's going to call Sheriff Webb. That the deal is off. That I deserve to lose everything—the farm, Claire, the one good thing that's happened to me in seventeen years.

And that Claire is never going to look at me the same way again. She saw what I really am. Saw the violence underneath all the careful breathing and counting.

She's scared of me now. And she should be.

The worst part—the thing that keeps me awake even after the sun starts turning the sky pink outside my window—is that I can't blame her.

I saw what I did. Saw myself on top of my father, fist rising and falling, unable to stop. Saw the blood and the broken fence and the wreckage of everything I'd built.

If I'm scared of what I'm capable of, why wouldn't she be?

At five-thirty I drag myself out of bed. My whole body aches—ribs, face, hands. But the physical pain is nothing compared to the sick dread in my stomach.

I should just not go. Should save Henderson the trouble of firing me. Should stay home and wait for Sheriff Webb to show up with handcuffs.

But I made a deal. Gave my word.

And maybe I'm violent and angry and exactly like my father in all the ways that matter, but Frank Dalton's son keeps his word.

So I get dressed, moving slowly because everything hurts. Pull on my work clothes that smell like sweat and dirt and honest labor. Look at myself one more time in the mirror.

The face looking back at me is a stranger's. Bruised and swollen and mean-looking. Not someone you'd trust. Not someone you'd want around your daughter.

Not someone worth believing in.

I walk out to my Chevy—the car I rebuilt from scrap metal because I thought if I could fix something broken, maybe I could prove I wasn't worthless. The irony isn't lost on me.

The drive to the Henderson farm feels like driving to my own execution.

Every turn of the wheel takes me closer to facing Tom Henderson. Closer to admitting that I failed. Closer to seeing Claire and knowing I put that scared expression on her face.

I should turn around. Should spare myself the humiliation.

But I keep driving.

The sun's just starting to come up when I pull into the Henderson farmyard. The broken fence is still there, rails splintered, posts tilted. Evidence of everything I destroyed yesterday.

I expect the farmyard to be empty. Expect to have to walk up to the house and knock and face Tom Henderson with his family around him. Face Claire.

But Henderson's already there. Standing by the barn in his work clothes, two cups of coffee steaming in the morning cold.

He sees me park. Sees me get out slowly, every movement painful. His expression doesn't change.

I walk over to him, my heart hammering, my hands already clenching into fists before I force them open.

This is it. This is where he tells me to leave. Where he says Sheriff Webb is on his way. Where he says I'm done here and to never come near his daughter again.

I brace for it.

Henderson hands me one of the coffee cups.

I take it automatically, too surprised to do anything else.

"Rough night?" he asks.

I don't know how to answer that, so I just nod.

"Your face looks worse than yesterday."

"Yeah."

We stand there in silence for a moment. The coffee is hot and black and strong. I drink it because I don't know what else to do.

Finally Henderson sets his cup down on a fence post and picks up a pair of work gloves.

"We need to repair the fence," he says, like it's just another item on a list of farm chores. "You and your father broke it. Now we fix it."

I stare at him. "You... you want me to fix it?"

"I want us to fix it," Henderson corrects. "Together. That's how this works, Rick. You break something, you fix it."

"I thought..." I trail off, not sure how to say it. "I thought the deal was off. I thought you'd want me gone after yesterday."

Henderson looks at me for a long moment. In the dawn light, his face looks tired, older than it did yesterday morning.

"Your father came by the house last night," he says quietly.

My stomach drops. "What?"

"Around nine. Drunk again. Started yelling about how I can't keep him from his son, how you're a violent troublemaker and I should've turned you over to Webb from the start."

Oh God. "What did you do?"

"Told him to leave. When he wouldn't, I told him if he ever sets foot on my property again, I will call Sheriff Webb and press charges for trespassing. Then I stood there and waited until he drove off."

Henderson picks up a hammer, tests the weight of it in his hand.

"Your father wants you to fail, Rick. Wants you to be exactly like him so he can feel better about his own choices. You know that, right?"

I nod, not trusting my voice.

"So the question is," Henderson continues, "are you going to let him be right? Are you going to decide that one bad moment defines you? Or are you going to do the harder thing and keep trying to be better?"

My throat is tight. "I don't know if I can."

"Can't or won't?"

"Can't. I tried all summer and yesterday I just... I lost it. I couldn't control it. I proved everyone right about what a Dalton really is."

Henderson is quiet for a moment. Then he says something I'm not expecting.

"You're not your father, Rick."

"Yesterday I was."

"No." Henderson's voice is firm. "Yesterday you got in a fight with a man who's been hurting you your whole life. You lost your temper. You made a mistake. But you're not him."

"How do you know?"

"Because you're here." Henderson gestures at the farmyard, at me standing there with coffee in my bruised hands. "You're here at dawn even though you think I'm going to fire you. You're here because you gave your word and you keep it. You're here because you want to fix what you broke. Frank Dalton wouldn't do any of those things."

He hands me the work gloves.

"But you have to choose not to be him," Henderson says. "Every single day. When you wake up angry. When someone pushes your buttons. When everything in you wants to hit something. You have to choose to be someone different. And some days you'll fail. But you get up the next day and choose again."

I look down at the gloves in my hand. They're worn and familiar now, shaped to my grip from months of work.

"I don't know if I can do it," I admit.

"Then figure it out," Henderson says. "Because I'm not giving up on you, Rick. But you have to decide if you're giving up on yourself."

He walks toward the broken fence, and after a moment, I follow.

We work in silence for an hour. Pulling out the broken rails, straightening the tilted posts, measuring for replacements. The same work I did at the beginning of summer when I first crashed through this fence.

The same work. The same fence.

But I'm not the same person.

At least, I don't want to be.

Henderson was right about one thing: I'm here. I showed up even though I was sure I'd be fired. Showed up even though facing him—facing Claire—is the last thing I want to do.

I showed up because I made a deal and I keep my word.

That has to count for something.

Doesn't it?
