# Chapter 7: Small Conversations

Late June, and the fence work is steady progress. Not exciting, but steady. We've replaced all the section I destroyed and moved on to repairs elsewhere on the property. It turns out Henderson wasn't kidding about having fence lines that needed attention—there's always another post that's rotting, another rail that needs replacing.

But the work's different now than it was those first couple weeks. Not easier, exactly. Just... different. Less like punishment and more like just work that needs doing.

And somewhere in there, Claire and I started talking.

Not about anything important at first. Just small things. Observations about the weather—hotter than usual for late June. Comments about the work—this section's going faster than the last one. Questions about logistics—do we have enough paint to finish the north fence?

But today, on a Tuesday afternoon when we're taking a water break under the oak tree, Claire asks me something that isn't about work.

"Your Chevy," she says, pouring water into our cups. "You really built it yourself? From scrap?"

I take my cup, surprised by the question. "Yeah. Bought the shell for twenty dollars from a guy who was using it as a chicken coop. Spent the next two years rebuilding it."

"How'd you learn? Your father teach you?"

The question makes me laugh, but it's not a happy sound. "No. My father doesn't know the difference between a carburetor and a cam shaft. I learned from library books. And trial and error. Mostly error."

Claire settles against the tree trunk, genuinely interested. "What was the hardest part?"

I think about it, remembering those two years in our garage. "The engine. I got a block from a junkyard but it was seized up. Spent three months just getting it freed up and cleaned out. Then I had to learn how to rebuild it—new pistons, rings, bearings. Every gasket. I must've taken that thing apart and put it back together five times before it would even turn over."

"But you kept at it."

"Didn't have anything else to do." I drink my water, remember those long nights in the garage. "And I wanted something that was mine. Something I made that worked. That I could control."

"Control," Claire repeats, like she's testing the word.

"Yeah. When you build an engine yourself, you know every piece of it. You know what it should sound like, how it should feel. You know when something's wrong before anyone else would notice. That's... that's power, I guess."

Claire's quiet for a moment, then asks, "Can you teach me?"

I almost choke on my water. "What?"

"Engines. Can you teach me how they work?"

"You want to learn about cars?"

"Tractors," she corrects. "We've got two tractors on this farm. My father won't teach me how to maintain them. Says I don't need to know because he'll handle it. But what if something breaks and he's not here? What if I need to—" She stops, frustrated. "I should know how to take care of my own equipment."

Her own equipment. The way she says it, with that quiet ownership, reminds me of how I feel about the Chevy.

"Tractor engines aren't that different from car engines," I say. "Bigger, simpler in some ways. Same basic principles."

"So you could teach me."

"I guess. If you want."

"I want." She sets her cup down. "Not now—we've got fence work. But maybe sometime. Sundays, or evenings when we're done."

The idea of spending even more time with Claire should feel like extending my sentence. But instead, I find myself saying, "Yeah. Okay. We can do that."

She smiles—quick and genuine—and it changes her whole face. Makes her look younger, less serious. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. You might hate it."

"I won't." She's certain about it, the same way she's certain about everything. "I like knowing how things work. Like knowing what I can fix myself."

We finish our water in comfortable silence, then get back to work. But the conversation stays with me for the rest of the afternoon. Claire wanting to learn. Asking me to teach her. Trusting that I know something worth knowing.

That evening, as we're putting tools away, she brings it up again.

"Why a Chevy?" she asks. "Why not a Ford or something else?"

"The Chevy was what I could afford. Twenty dollars was all I had saved up. But I'm glad it was a Chevy. The '55 has good lines. And the small block V8 is a solid engine. Parts aren't too hard to find."

"But you customized it. I've seen it—it's not stock."

I'm surprised she noticed. "Lowered the suspension. Changed the gearing. Custom paint. Little things that make it mine."

"The paint's good. That blue."

"Thanks. Did it myself. Three coats of primer, four coats of color, two of clear. Wet sanded between each one."

"That's a lot of work."

"Best part of the whole build, actually. By that point the engine was done and running. The paint was just making it look as good as it performed."

Claire's organizing wrenches on the pegboard, but I can tell she's listening to every word. "My father says hot rods are a waste of money. That if a car runs, that's all that matters."

"Your father probably thinks farms should just be functional too. No need to make them look nice if they produce crops."

She glances at me, eyebrow raised. "That's different."

"Is it? You take pride in the farm looking good. Neat rows in the garden. Straight fence lines. Fresh paint on the barn. That's not just functional—that's making something look as good as it works."

Claire's quiet for a moment, then nods. "Fair point. I never thought about it that way."

"Most people don't think about cars that way either. They think transportation. But for me, the Chevy's more than that. It's proof I can build something. That I'm not just..."

I trail off, not sure how to finish that sentence.

"Not just what?" Claire asks quietly.

"Not just my father's son. Not just the Dalton kid everyone expects to fail."

The words come out before I can stop them, more honest than I meant to be. I busy myself coiling a rope, avoiding her eyes.

"That's why you work on it," Claire says. Not a question. "Same reason I want to learn about tractors. Because it's yours and you built it."

I look at her then, and she's watching me with that calm, steady gaze. But there's understanding in it now. Recognition.

"Yeah," I say. "Exactly that."

"My father doesn't understand why I want agricultural school," she continues, hanging up the last of the tools. "He thinks I should just know enough to help until I get married and it becomes my husband's farm. But it's not about helping. It's about it being mine."

"The farm?"

"All of it. The planning, the planting, the maintaining. I want to run a modern operation. Use better irrigation systems, crop rotation, soil management. Things they're teaching at the agricultural colleges. But my father thinks the old ways are good enough."

"Are they?"

"They work. But they could work better. We could produce more with less effort if we modernized. But he won't even consider it because I'm—" She stops, shakes her head.

"Because you're a girl."

"Because I'm his daughter and he thinks he's protecting me by keeping things simple. But I don't want simple. I want to build something. Make this farm better than it's ever been."

The passion in her voice reminds me of how I feel when I talk about the Chevy. That same need to create, to prove, to make something that's undeniably yours.

"That's why you packed extra lunch for me that first week," I realize. "Not because you felt sorry for me. Because you understand what it's like to work for something you care about."

Claire closes the shed door, locks it. "I packed extra lunch because watching you pass out from hunger would slow down the work. But yes, I understand wanting to build something. Same reason you care about your car."

"Because it's yours and you built it," I echo her earlier words.

"Exactly."

We walk toward where my Chevy's parked. The sun's getting lower, painting everything golden. The farm looks different in this light—softer, prettier. Or maybe I'm just seeing it differently now.

"Next Sunday," Claire says as I reach my car door. "If you're serious about teaching me about engines. The old tractor in the far barn needs maintenance anyway. Good opportunity."

"Next Sunday," I agree. "Bring something to take notes with. And wear clothes you don't mind getting oil on."

"I work on a farm, Rick. All my clothes have something on them already."

She's smiling when she says it, teasing, and I find myself smiling back.

"Fair point."

I climb in the Chevy, start it up. The engine roars to life—smooth and perfect, every valve timed exactly right. Claire steps back, listening to it with that focused attention she gives everything.

"Sounds good," she says.

"Should. I rebuilt it right."

"I believe you."

Those three words—simple, straightforward—hit different than I expect. She believes me. Believes I built something good. Believes I know what I'm talking about.

I drive home thinking about Claire wanting to learn about tractors. About her saying the farm is hers and she built it, even though her father owns it legally. About the way she listens when I talk about the Chevy, really listens, like what I'm saying matters.

About the way we're having conversations now instead of just working in silence.

And the strangest part is, I like it. I like talking to Claire. I like explaining things to her and hearing about what she wants to build. I like that she sees the Chevy as more than just a car, the way I see the farm as more than just dirt and crops.

When I get home, my father's in his usual spot on the couch. But instead of the usual resentment, I just feel... nothing. He's his life. I've got mine.

And right now, my life includes teaching Claire Henderson about tractor engines next Sunday.

Which is weird. But not bad weird.

Just... different.
