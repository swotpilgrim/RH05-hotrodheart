# Chapter 12: Common Ground

The last week of July, and the work on the Henderson farm has settled into something close to comfortable.

Not easy—it's still hard labor in the heat, still hours of digging and lifting. But it doesn't feel like punishment anymore. It feels like work that needs doing.

Claire and I talk more now while we're working. Not constantly—we still have long stretches of quiet—but when we do talk, it's real conversation. Not just logistics.

We talk about things that matter.

Friday afternoon, we're working on reinforcing a section of fence near the barn, and Claire asks, "So what's your plan? After graduation. You really going to leave Pine Valley?"

I drive a nail into a fence rail before answering. "Yeah. I think so."

"Where would you go?"

"Detroit, maybe. Auto plants, repair shops, garages. Plenty of work for someone who knows engines." I grab another nail. "And it's big enough that nobody would know me. I could just be Rick. Some guy who works on cars."

Claire paints a fresh coat of white on the rail. "You really think you can outrun your past like that?"

"I'm not trying to outrun it. I'm trying to find a place where it doesn't define everything about me."

"There's a difference?"

"One's running away. The other's moving toward something new."

Claire considers this. "What would you do in Detroit? Besides work."

"Save money. Build a better car. Maybe race legally on a track." The idea forms as I say it. "Work my way up to owning my own garage eventually. A small place where I could build and repair engines the right way."

"That sounds good, Rick. Like an actual plan instead of just escape."

"Yeah, well. Two more years of school first. Then saving enough money to actually leave. So it's a long way off."

We work in silence, and then Claire says quietly, "I don't want to leave."

I look at her, surprised.

"Pine Valley, I mean. Everyone assumes I'll go away to college or move to the city. But I don't want better. I want this." She gestures at the farm. "I want to stay right here and run this place the way it should be run."

"But your father won't let you go to Michigan State."

"That's the irony. He won't let me leave to learn, but he also won't let me really stay. Because staying means eventually handing the farm to my husband, not to me. So I'm trapped here but not allowed to actually have it."

I drive another nail. "So I'm stuck in Pine Valley wanting to leave, and you're in Pine Valley wanting to stay. But neither of us gets what we want."

"Exactly." Claire finishes painting her section and steps back. "You can't escape your reputation, and I can't convince anyone I'm capable of running a farm without a man."

"That's ridiculous."

"Which part?"

"Both parts, but especially the second one. You're more capable than half the farmers in this county. You know this land better than anyone."

"Tell that to my father."

"I would if I thought it would help."

Claire looks at me, surprised and almost amused. "You'd tell Tom Henderson that his sixteen-year-old daughter knows more about farming than he does?"

"If it was true. And it is."

She laughs—a real, genuine laugh that lights up her whole face. "You're either very brave or very stupid."

"Can't it be both?"

That makes her laugh again, and I realize I like making her laugh. Like the way her expression breaks into something lighter.

"We're quite a pair," I say. "Both trapped in opposite ways. You want to stay and prove yourself. I want to leave and be myself. Neither of us can do what we want."

"At least we understand each other."

"Yeah. At least there's that."

We finish the fence section and move to the next one. The work continues, steady and familiar. And somewhere along the way, I realize I don't mind being here anymore.

Don't mind working beside Claire Henderson.

Actually, I'm starting to like it.

At noon, we head to our usual spot under the oak tree. Claire unpacks sandwiches and lemonade—she always brings enough for both of us now. Just hands me food like it's natural.

We're halfway through eating when Tom Henderson walks over.

"How's the north fence looking?" he asks, settling onto the grass.

"Good," Claire says. "We reinforced the weak section and replaced another six posts. Should be solid."

"Good." Henderson takes a drink from his water jug. "After lunch, I need you two to check the irrigation lines in the south field. Been some dry patches. Probably a leak somewhere."

Claire nods. I notice she doesn't say anything. Just listens.

"And the barn roof," Henderson continues, "I saw some loose shingles on the east side. Better get those secured before heavy rain. Don't need water damage in the hay storage."

"I'll take care of it," Claire says.

"Make sure Rick helps you with the ladder work. Don't want you climbing up there alone."

"I've climbed that roof a hundred times."

"I know, but it's safer with two people. Rick, you good with heights?"

"Yeah, Mr. Henderson. I can handle it."

"Good man." Henderson finishes his water and stands. "I'll be in the far field if you need me."

He walks away, and I watch Claire's face. She's looking down at her sandwich, jaw tight.

"You okay?" I ask.

"Fine."

"You don't look fine."

Claire sets down her sandwich. "Did you notice what just happened?"

"Your father gave us afternoon work?"

"My father told me what needs doing on my own farm. Didn't ask if I'd noticed the dry patches—which I had. Didn't ask if I knew about the shingles—which I did. Just listed tasks like I'm an employee who needs instruction."

I think back. She's right—Henderson didn't ask her opinion. Just told her what to do.

"He does that a lot," Claire continues quietly. "Talks at me instead of with me. Like I'm just another farmhand who needs managing."

"That's his problem, not yours."

Claire looks up sharply. "What?"

"It's his problem. He's the one who doesn't see how capable you are. That's his failing, not yours."

She stares at me like I just said something profound.

"You know this farm better than he does. You notice things before he does. You work harder than anyone I've met. The fact that he doesn't see that—that's on him. Not on you."

"He's my father. He's supposed to see me."

"Yeah, he is. And it's wrong that he doesn't. But that doesn't mean you're not capable."

Claire is quiet for a long minute. "Nobody's ever said that to me before."

"Said what?"

"That it's his problem. Everyone else makes excuses. 'He's traditional,' 'He's protecting you,' 'He means well.' Like his intentions matter more than the result."

"Intentions don't mean much if they make you feel invisible."

"No. They don't."

We finish lunch in silence, but it's not uncomfortable. Claire keeps glancing at me like I said something that mattered.

And maybe I did.

When we pack up and head to check the irrigation lines, the afternoon feels different. We're not just working together anymore. We're on the same side.

The irrigation work is hot and tedious. We walk the rows checking each line for leaks. The kind of work that would be miserable alone but passes quicker with company.

"Can I ask you something?" Claire says.

"Yeah."

"In Detroit, when nobody knows your name. What do you think you'll be?"

"What do you mean?"

"You're so focused on not being Frank Dalton's son. But who will you be instead?"

The question catches me off guard.

"I don't know," I admit. "I've spent so much time thinking about who I don't want to be that I haven't figured out who I actually am."

"Maybe that's what you'll figure out in Detroit."

"Maybe."

"Or maybe," Claire says carefully, "you'll figure it out before then. Maybe you're already becoming who you're supposed to be."

I stop walking. "What do you mean?"

Claire turns to face me. "The Rick Dalton who showed up here in June was angry and defensive. But the Rick standing here right now is different. Steadier. Someone who works hard and keeps his word and says things like 'that's his problem, not yours' when I need to hear it."

"I'm still angry."

"I know. But you're handling it better. Choosing what to do with it."

"Because of you," I say before I can stop myself. "You didn't treat me like I was hopeless. You asked what I was really angry about and actually listened."

"That's what people are supposed to do."

"Yeah, well. Most people don't."

We stand there, and something passes between us again. That understanding. The feeling that we're seeing each other in a way nobody else does.

"We should finish checking the lines," Claire says finally.

"Yeah."

We keep walking, keep checking. But something's shifted. We're not just allies against our traps anymore.

We're something else. Something I don't have a name for yet.

Something that feels important and fragile and dangerous.

By the time we finish with the irrigation lines and secure the loose shingles on the barn roof, the day is winding down. The sun's getting lower, painting everything in golden light.

"Good work today," Claire says as we're putting tools away.

"You too."

"Same time Monday?"

"Same time Monday."

I drive home thinking about Detroit. About leaving Pine Valley and starting over somewhere nobody knows my name.

But for the first time, the idea doesn't excite me the way it used to. For the first time, I'm thinking about what I'd be leaving behind.

Not the town. Not my father's house or his reputation.

Claire.

I'd be leaving Claire.

And that thought sits heavy in my chest in a way I don't quite understand yet.

Or maybe I do understand it, and I just don't want to admit what it means.

Because wanting something—wanting someone—is dangerous when you're used to losing everything.

And I've got a feeling that Claire Henderson might be something I can't afford to want.

But it's too late now.

I already do.
