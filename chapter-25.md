# Chapter 25: What Anger Really Is

Saturday morning finds me and Claire working on the irrigation system in the south field. It's messy work—crawling through dirt and mud, clearing out clogs, making sure water can actually flow where it needs to go. Not glamorous, but necessary.

We've been working in comfortable silence for about an hour when Claire says, "Can we talk about Wednesday?"

My whole body tenses. I'm up to my elbows in mud, clearing out a pipe, and suddenly I'm very aware of how vulnerable that position is.

"What about it?" I ask, keeping my voice carefully neutral.

"About the fight. About what happened."

I pull my hands out of the pipe and sit back on my heels. "I thought we already talked about that. You said you weren't giving up on me, and I'm trying to believe you. What else is there to say?"

"I want to talk about the anger," Claire says.

My jaw tightens. "The anger that made me beat my own father bloody in your farmyard? That anger?"

"Yes."

I shake my head, go back to clearing the pipe. "Nothing to talk about. I lost control. End of story."

"Rick." Claire's voice is patient but firm. "Look at me."

I don't want to. Want to keep my hands busy and my eyes down and avoid this whole conversation.

But she asked. And I'm trying to be better about not shutting her out.

So I look at her.

She's sitting cross-legged in the dirt, her work dress already stained with mud, her hair escaping from its braid like always. She looks like she belongs here, in this field, in this life.

And she's looking at me like I matter. Like what she's about to say is important.

"Anger isn't the problem," she says.

I blink. "What?"

"Your anger. It's not the problem."

"Claire, I beat the hell out of my father because I was angry. How is that not a problem?"

"Because everyone gets angry," she says simply. "Anger is a normal emotion. It's human. It's not something you can just turn off or wish away."

I start to argue, but she holds up a hand.

"Let me finish. Anger isn't the problem. What you do with the anger—that's what matters."

I sit there in the mud, trying to process what she's saying.

"You've spent all summer thinking that being angry makes you like your father," Claire continues. "That if you feel rage, it means you're broken or doomed or worthless. But that's not true, Rick. Your father isn't angry. He's drunk and bitter and mean. Those are choices he makes."

"He's angry too," I point out.

"Maybe. But he uses his anger as an excuse. He lets it justify treating people badly. He wallows in it instead of dealing with it." Claire leans forward. "That's not what you do."

"I lost control Wednesday—"

"After months of learning to redirect it," Claire interrupts. "After months of breathing through it and counting to ten and working it out through physical labor. After months of choosing not to explode even when you wanted to."

She gestures at the irrigation pipe, at the field around us.

"I've watched you all summer, Rick. I've seen you stop yourself a hundred times. Seen you take a breath when something frustrated you. Seen you walk away instead of fighting. Seen you channel your anger into fixing things instead of breaking them."

"But Wednesday—"

"Wednesday your father showed up drunk and pushed every single button you have," Claire says. "He attacked you where you're most vulnerable. And yes, you lost control. But one moment doesn't erase months of progress. It doesn't mean the anger is the problem. It means you're still learning how to manage it."

I don't know what to say to that. I've spent so long believing that being angry means I'm broken that the idea it might be normal—that it might be okay—doesn't compute.

"Everyone gets angry, Rick," Claire says again, softer this time. "Even me."

That surprises me. "You? You're the calmest person I've ever met."

"Because I've learned to redirect it," she says. "But I get angry all the time. Angry at my father for not taking me seriously. Angry at this town for deciding who I should be before I get a say. Angry at myself for being too scared to fight harder for what I want."

She picks up a stick, starts drawing patterns in the dirt.

"I'm angry that my father thinks I don't need to go to college. That he looks at me and sees someone whose only value is being a good wife someday. That he can't imagine I might want more than what Pine Valley has to offer."

There's heat in her voice now. Real frustration.

"I'm angry that Jenny and the other girls talk about boys and marriage like that's all there is. That they think I'm weird for wanting to learn about agricultural science. That they can't understand why I'd rather spend my time reading about soil composition than gossiping at the diner."

She looks at me, and her eyes are fierce.

"I'm angry, Rick. I'm angry a lot. But I don't let it eat me alive. I don't let it turn me into someone bitter. I use it."

"How?"

"I channel it into working harder. Into learning more. Into planning for the future I want instead of the one everyone expects me to have." She drops the stick. "I get angry, and then I decide what to do with it. That's the difference."

I think about that. About how she works on this farm with the same intensity I work on engines. How she reads those agricultural books like they hold the secrets to everything. How she's applying to Michigan State even though her father said no.

She's angry. But she's also focused. Driven. Building something instead of just tearing things down.

"I don't know how to do that," I admit. "I don't know how to use it instead of just... being consumed by it."

"Yes you do," Claire says. "You've been doing it all summer."

"I haven't—"

"What did you do when you got frustrated with the fence posts not setting right?" she asks.

I think back. "I took a break. Came back to it later."

"And when Bobby made that comment about you going soft?"

"I walked away instead of hitting him."

"And when you're working on the Chevy and something won't fit right?"

"I..." I pause. "I work on a different part until I cool down. Then I come back to the problem."

Claire smiles. "See? You already know how to redirect anger. You've been doing it for months. Wednesday was hard because it wasn't just anger—it was years of pain and fear all coming to a head at once. But that doesn't mean you don't know how to handle it. It just means you're still learning."

She reaches over and taps my bandaged knuckles gently.

"You rebuilt a car from scrap metal, Rick. Bought a shell for twenty dollars and turned it into something beautiful. That took years. Patience. Learning from mistakes. Trying things that didn't work and figuring out what would."

Her hand lingers on mine.

"You can rebuild yourself too," she says quietly. "It's the same process. You try. You fail sometimes. You learn. You try again. Eventually you figure it out."

I look down at our hands. Hers small and sure on top of mine. Mine bruised and bandaged from fighting my father.

"I don't feel like I'm figuring it out," I admit.

"Because you're in the middle of it," Claire says. "You can't see the progress when you're this close. But I can. My father can. We've watched you change this summer, Rick. Watched you become someone who thinks before reacting. Someone who channels anger into work instead of violence. Someone who chooses to be better."

"And when I mess up?" I ask. "When I fail?"

"Then you get up the next day and choose again," Claire says simply. "That's all any of us can do."

She stands up, brushes dirt from her dress. Offers me her hand.

I take it, let her pull me to my feet. My ribs protest, but I don't care.

"Anger isn't your enemy," Claire says. "It's just an emotion. What you do with it—that's what defines you."

She picks up the tools we've been using, starts walking toward the next section of irrigation pipe that needs clearing.

I stand there for a moment, watching her go, trying to absorb what she just said.

Anger is normal. Everyone gets angry. It's not evidence I'm broken or doomed or just like my father.

It's what I do with it that matters.

And I've been learning, all summer, how to do something productive with it. How to breathe and count and channel it into work. How to build instead of destroy.

Wednesday was a setback. A failure. But not proof that I haven't made progress.

Just proof that I'm still learning.

I look down at my bandaged hands. At the mud on my clothes. At the field around me that I've been helping to maintain all summer.

I rebuilt a car from scrap metal.

Maybe Claire's right. Maybe I can rebuild myself too.

It won't be perfect. I'll make mistakes. I'll have more Wednesdays where I lose control and have to start over.

But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just part of the process.

Maybe being better doesn't mean never getting angry. It just means choosing, every single day, what to do with the anger when it comes.

And if Claire can believe in that—can believe in me—then maybe I can start believing it too.

I follow her to the next section of pipe, and we get back to work. Clearing out mud and debris, making sure water can flow where it needs to go.

It's not glamorous work. It's dirty and exhausting and thankless.

But it's building something. Maintaining something. Making sure things grow instead of die.

And maybe that's exactly what I need to be doing.

Not just with this irrigation system, but with myself.

Clear out the debris. Fix what's broken. Make sure good things can grow.

One day at a time. One choice at a time.

It's a start.

And for the first time since Wednesday, I think maybe it's enough.
