# Chapter 6: The Routine Sets In

Three weeks into the summer, and I don't need the alarm clock anymore.

My body wakes me up at five-thirty without fail. My hands have calluses now where the blisters used to be. My muscles don't scream quite as loud when I get out of bed. I'm still sore—probably will be all summer—but it's a different kind of sore. The kind that says I'm getting stronger instead of beaten down.

I arrive at the Henderson farm at five fifty-five without thinking about it. Park in the same spot. Grab my gloves. Walk to the tool shed where Claire's usually already pulling out what we'll need.

It's become routine. And I hate that I don't hate it as much as I should.

Monday morning, Claire's checking the new fence posts we set last week, making sure none of them have shifted. I join her without being asked, testing each post for stability, checking the tension on the rails we've started adding.

"This one's loose," I say, wiggling a post that gives more than it should.

Claire comes over, examines it. "Ground's softer here. We'll need to pack more stone around the base."

"I'll get the wheelbarrow."

I head to the barn, fill the wheelbarrow with gravel, bring it back. We spend the next hour resetting the post—digging out soft dirt, packing in gravel, making sure it's level. It's the kind of work that used to make me want to throw tools, but now it's just work. Needs doing, so we do it.

By the time we finish, the sun's higher and the June heat is building. Claire wipes her forehead, leaving a smudge of dirt.

"Water break?"

"Yeah."

We head to the oak tree. Fresh water in the jug—probably her mother. Claire pours two cups and we sit in the shade, not talking, just drinking and catching our breath.

This has become the pattern. We work until around two PM when the heat gets too intense, then shift to lighter tasks—measuring, planning, organizing. Around six or seven, depending on daylight, we call it a day.

Six days a week. Dawn to dusk. Just like Henderson said.

And somewhere along the way, I stopped fighting it.

Not because I suddenly love farm work or forgave myself for crashing through their fence. I stopped fighting because fighting was exhausting, and Claire made it clear she wasn't giving me an easy out. That day in the tool shed, kneeling on the floor picking up nails and wrenches—that was when I realized I could spend the whole summer angry and miserable, or I could just do the work and get through it.

So I do the work.

Tuesday, we're repairing a section of fence on the north side that has nothing to do with my crash. Just regular maintenance that needed doing. Claire explains Henderson's been putting it off, focused on the crops.

"So I'm actually helping," I say, pulling out a rotted board.

"Don't let it go to your head." But there's almost amusement in her voice.

We work side by side, replacing boards, reinforcing posts. Tom Henderson stops by mid-morning, nods approvingly, then heads back to the south fields. Mostly though, it's just Claire and me.

And that's when I start noticing things.

Not big things. Small things. Details I wouldn't have paid attention to when I was too busy being angry.

Like the way Claire handles tools. She's not just competent—she's good. Really good. When she's examining a fence post, running her hands over the wood, she can tell if it's rotted without tapping it or digging at it. She just knows, the way I know when an engine's running rough before I look under the hood.

"How do you do that?" I ask when she declares a post needs replacing without any visible inspection.

"Do what?"

"Know it's bad. You didn't even test it."

She shrugs. "I've been doing this since I was eight. You learn to feel the difference. Solid wood feels different than rotted wood, even through the paint."

"Show me."

Claire walks over to the post she just condemned, takes my hand, and presses my palm against the wood. "Feel that? How it gives just slightly? Like there's nothing solid behind the surface?"

I focus on what I'm feeling. She's right—there's a subtle give to it, a softness that shouldn't be there.

"Now feel this one." She moves my hand to the post next to it. This one is solid, firm, no give at all.

"I feel it," I say.

"That's the difference. Once you know what to look for, you don't have to guess."

She drops my hand and goes back to work, but I'm still thinking about how she just taught me something without making it feel like a lesson. Just showed me, expected me to understand, moved on.

Wednesday, I notice she hums while she works.

Not loud. Not even a real song, exactly. Just this quiet, absent-minded humming that happens when she's focused on something. It takes me half the morning to realize she's doing it, and another hour to realize it doesn't annoy me.

It should annoy me. I'm not here by choice. I shouldn't be comfortable enough with Claire Henderson to find her unconscious humming anything but irritating.

But I don't.

Thursday, we're working on the garden. The one I destroyed is replanted now—neat rows of seedlings that Claire tends carefully every morning and evening. Today we're building a better irrigation system so she doesn't have to hand-water everything.

"Your dad doesn't help with this?" I ask, digging a shallow trench for the water line.

"Sometimes. But he's got the fields to manage. The garden is mine."

"So you do all this yourself."

"Usually."

"That's a lot of work on top of everything else."

Claire looks up from the seedling she's transplanting. "Are you actually concerned about my workload, or are you just making conversation?"

I stop digging, think about it. "I don't know. Both?"

"Honest answer." She goes back to her work. "I like the garden. It's mine to plan and manage. My dad doesn't tell me what to plant or how to do it. It's the one part of the farm that's completely my project."

"Until I drove through it."

"Until you drove through it," she agrees. "But it's back now. Better irrigation this time, thanks to you."

It's the first time she's acknowledged that my being here has had any benefit beyond me paying off a debt. The comment catches me off guard, and I don't know how to respond, so I just go back to digging.

Friday afternoon, we're taking a break under the oak tree when Claire asks, "You're different than you were three weeks ago. What changed?"

I drink my water, buying time to think about the answer. "I stopped trying to make you fire me."

"I noticed. Why?"

"Because you weren't going to."

"That's not a reason. That's just you admitting I called your bluff."

She's right. I set my cup down, lean back against the tree trunk. "I was exhausted. Fighting you, fighting the work, being angry all the time—it was harder than just doing the job. So I stopped."

"Just like that?"

"Just like that."

Claire's quiet for a moment, and I can feel her watching me. "You know, when my father first suggested this arrangement, I thought it was a terrible idea. Thought you'd be here two days before you quit or messed up bad enough that we'd have to call Webb anyway."

"Sorry to disappoint you."

"You didn't disappoint me." She says it matter-of-factly, like she's commenting on the weather. "You surprised me. There's a difference."

I look at her, and she's not smiling exactly, but there's something softer in her expression than the careful neutrality she usually wears.

"You're not what I expected either," I say before I can stop myself.

"What did you expect?"

"I don't know. Someone who'd hold the whole fence thing over my head. Someone who'd enjoy making me pay for it."

"I don't enjoy it," Claire says quietly. "I just think people should keep their commitments. You said you'd work the summer, so you work the summer. That's all."

"That's all," I repeat, but even as I say it, I know it's not all. Not anymore.

Because somewhere in the last three weeks, this stopped being just about working off a debt. It became something else. A routine. A rhythm. Two people working together because the work needs doing and because—and this is the part that bothers me—we're actually pretty good at working together.

I notice things about Claire now that I was too angry to see before. The way she knows exactly which tool she needs before she asks for it. The way she explains things clearly without talking down to me. The way she's patient when I mess up but expects me to do better next time.

The way she hums when she's focused.

The way the silence between us isn't uncomfortable anymore.

Saturday, we finish the week's work early—all planned fence repairs done, garden irrigation system installed and tested. Tom Henderson comes by to inspect, nods his approval.

"Good work," he says to both of us, but he's looking at me. "You've earned your rest day tomorrow."

After he leaves, Claire and I put tools away in the shed, organizing for Monday. Our end-of-week ritual—making sure everything's where it should be.

"You got any plans for Sunday?" Claire asks, hanging up the last of the shovels.

"Sleep. Maybe work on the Chevy a little. You?"

"Church in the morning. Probably help my mother in the afternoon." She closes the shed door, locks it. "Same as always."

We walk toward where my Chevy's parked. The sun's setting, painting the sky orange and pink, and the farm looks different in this light. Peaceful. Almost beautiful.

"See you Monday," Claire says.

"Yeah. Monday."

I drive home, and for the first time since this whole thing started, I'm not dreading Monday morning. I'm not looking forward to it, exactly—it's still hard work that I'm doing because I have to, not because I want to.

But I'm not dreading it.

And I realize as I pull into my driveway that I've stopped counting the days until the summer ends. Stopped calculating how many more weeks I have to endure. Stopped viewing every morning as one more day to get through.

It's become just... what I do.

Wake up. Drive to the Henderson farm. Work with Claire until the day's done. Go home. Repeat.

A routine.

And routines, I'm learning, aren't always bad. Sometimes they're just the shape your life takes when you stop fighting it and start living it instead.

Even if it's not the life you would have chosen.
