# Chapter 14: The Calm Around Her

Saturday night, and I'm under the Chevy changing oil when Bobby shows up.

I hear his car before I see it—the rumble of his modified engine. I slide out from under the Chevy, wiping my hands, and Bobby's leaning against his hot rod grinning.

"Look who's finally home on a Saturday night," he says. "Thought maybe you'd moved into the Henderson barn."

"Just doing maintenance."

"On a Saturday night. When you could be having fun." Bobby walks around my Chevy. "When's the last time you actually drove this thing instead of just working on it?"

I think about it. "Couple weeks, maybe."

"Couple weeks." Bobby shakes his head. "Man, you really have gone domestic. Come on—let's race. Back roads, just like old times. Unless you're scared after the crash."

"I'm not scared."

"Then prove it. Let's go."

Six weeks ago, I would have said yes without thinking. Racing was what I did.

But now the idea just makes me tired.

"Not tonight," I say.

"Not tonight? Since when do you turn down a race?"

"Since I've got things to do tomorrow."

"Things to do. On a Sunday." Bobby's grin fades. "You really are different. You've changed."

"I haven't changed. I just don't feel like racing tonight."

"You don't feel like racing. You don't come around. You spend all your time on that farm with the Henderson girl." Bobby studies me. "That's what this is about, isn't it?"

"What?"

"You and Claire Henderson. That's why you're acting all different and responsible."

"I'm working off a debt. That's all."

"Is it?" Bobby's tone shifts, gets pointed. "Because word around town is you two are pretty cozy out there. Working real close together."

Heat rises in my chest. "We're working. That's what happens when two people fix fences together."

"Sure. Just working. That why Jenny Morrison saw you two laughing together at the farm last week? Looking all comfortable?"

"Jenny Morrison should mind her own business."

"Touchy." Bobby grins, but there's something mean in it now. "I'm just saying, you're different. Acting all mature and calm. Not like yourself."

"Maybe I'm tired of being what people expect."

"Or maybe you're trying to be what the Henderson girl expects. Think if you play farm boy all summer, she'll forget you're Frank Dalton's kid?"

My hands clench. "Drop it, Bobby."

"I'm just looking out for you. Don't want to see you get hurt when she remembers you're not good enough."

"I said drop it."

But Bobby doesn't drop it. Never does when he's on a roll.

"Come on," he says. "Let's get out of here. Go to Murphy's, get some food, remember what it was like when you weren't whipped by some farm girl."

I should say no.

But part of me wants to prove I haven't changed that much.

"Fine," I say. "Let me clean up."

Twenty minutes later we're at Murphy's Diner. It's crowded—families, teenagers, couples. Jenny Morrison is behind the counter, red hair in a ponytail.

We slide into a booth and Jenny comes over with menus.

"Rick Dalton," she says, smiling. "Haven't seen you in a while. Been busy?"

"Working," I say.

"I heard. Farm work at the Hendersons." Jenny leans against the table. "Actually saw you and Claire the other day. You two looked like you were having a good time. She was laughing at something you said."

Bobby perks up. "Oh yeah? Rick here was just telling me how it's all strictly professional out there."

"Looked pretty friendly to me," Jenny says. "What can I get you boys?"

We order, and Jenny heads back to the kitchen. Bobby's grinning across the table at me.

"Strictly professional, huh?"

"It is."

"Sure. You just make her laugh because you're such a great fence builder."

"Drop it."

"I'm just saying, you got a thing for her."

"I don't have a thing for anyone."

"Man, you're a terrible liar." Bobby leans back. "Look, I get it. She's pretty, she's smart, her family's got money. But come on. You really think Claire Henderson is interested in you? What are you going to do, be her hired help for life?"

I don't answer. Can't. Because he's saying out loud all the things I tell myself late at night.

"She's slumming it with you for the summer," Bobby continues. "Having her little project—reform the bad boy. But when summer ends? She'll forget you. Move on to some college boy who doesn't have a drunk father."

"Shut up, Bobby."

"I'm just being realistic. Girls like Claire Henderson don't end up with guys like us."

"I said shut up."

But Bobby's on a roll now. "What do you think would happen if you actually tried something with her? Think her dad would let the Dalton kid date his precious daughter? Think the town would—"

"I said shut up!"

My voice carries across the diner. People turn to look. Jenny pauses mid-order.

Bobby just grins. "See? There's the old Rick. Was wondering where he went."

And something in me snaps.

I'm out of the booth and grabbing Bobby's shirt before I register moving. Hauling him up, shoving him back against the wall next to our table. My face inches from his, breathing hard, seeing red.

"Don't talk about her like that," I growl.

Bobby's eyes are wide, but he's still smirking. "Like what? Like she's too good for you? It's the truth, man."

I pull him forward and slam him back against the wall harder. "You don't know anything about her. About us. So keep her name out of your mouth."

"Rick!" Jenny's voice, sharp. "Let him go!"

But I don't let him go. My hands are fisted in Bobby's shirt and all the anger I've been controlling for weeks is right there, ready to explode. Ready to teach Bobby a lesson about running his mouth.

My fist pulls back, ready to swing.

And then I stop.

Just stop.

Because somewhere in the red haze of rage, I hear Claire's voice. Not really—she's not here. But I hear it anyway.

*What are you really angry about, Rick?*

I'm breathing hard, fist still cocked, Bobby's shirt bunched in my other hand. The diner is quiet. Everyone's watching.

And I realize: I'm about to punch my best friend in a crowded diner because he said things I already think about myself. Because he voiced my own fears out loud.

That's not worth fighting over.

That's just me looking for an excuse to lose control.

Slowly—so slowly—I unclench my fist. Drop it to my side. Let go of Bobby's shirt.

He stumbles, catching himself against the wall, staring at me like he doesn't know who I am.

Maybe he doesn't. Maybe I don't either.

"Don't talk about Claire," I say quietly. "That's not negotiable."

I walk out of the diner without looking back.

The night air hits me cold. I stand next to the Chevy, hands shaking, trying to process what just happened.

I almost hit Bobby. Came within a heartbeat of throwing a punch that would have started a full fight.

But I didn't.

I stopped myself. Chose not to swing.

That's new.

Six weeks ago, Bobby saying those things would have ended in blood. Someone would have gotten hurt.

But tonight I stopped. Heard Claire's voice asking what I was really angry about, and realized the answer wasn't Bobby. It was me. My own doubts.

And hitting Bobby wouldn't fix those.

I'm still standing there when Bobby comes out, walking carefully, watching me like I might explode again.

"Man," he says. "You really have changed."

"Maybe."

"Old Rick would have punched me without thinking. But you just... stopped. Like you had to think about whether it was worth it."

"It wasn't worth it."

Bobby leans against his car, studying me. "She's good for you, you know. The Henderson girl. I was wrong to talk about her like that. But she's... she's making you better, I think."

"Her name is Claire."

"Claire. Right." Bobby's quiet for a minute. "You really like her."

It's not a question, so I don't answer.

"Does she know?"

"No. And she's not going to. Because you're right about one thing—girls like Claire Henderson don't end up with guys like me."

"I don't know, man. The way Jenny said you two were laughing together... maybe she likes you too."

"Doesn't matter. Summer ends, I'm done working there. She goes back to her life, I go back to mine."

"And that's it? You're just going to walk away?"

I don't have an answer for that. Don't know if I could walk away even if it's the right thing to do.

Bobby pushes off his car. "For what it's worth, I think you're wrong. About not being good enough. You're different now, Rick. Steadier. Like you've got something to work for instead of just something to run from."

"When did you get all philosophical?"

"Since my best friend almost punched me and then didn't. Made me think." He opens his car door. "You want a ride home?"

"I'll walk. Need to clear my head."

"Yeah. Okay." Bobby starts his engine, then leans out the window. "Rick? She'd be lucky to have you. Just so you know."

He drives off before I can respond.

I walk home thinking about what just happened. About stopping myself mid-fight. About choosing not to hit Bobby.

About how that's Claire's influence. Her calm. The way she asks what I'm really angry about instead of just reacting.

She's changing me. Has been all summer. Teaching me—without even trying—that I don't have to surrender to rage every time. That I can feel it, acknowledge it, and still choose something different.

That I can be someone other than Frank Dalton's son.

I'm not sure if that's good or terrifying.

Maybe both.

But walking home under the stars, hands still shaking slightly from adrenaline, I know one thing for certain:

I don't want to go back to who I was before Claire. Don't want to be the Rick who threw punches first and thought about it never. Who exploded at everything and everyone. Who was ruled by anger instead of ruling it.

Claire sees me as capable of being better. And somehow, around her, I am better.

The question is whether I can stay that way when summer ends and she's not around to remind me.

I don't know the answer.

But I'm starting to think I don't want to find out.

Because the idea of being without Claire—of not seeing her every morning, not working beside her, not hearing her laugh or listening to her explain soil science—that hurts worse than any punch I could have thrown.

And that tells me everything I need to know about how I feel.

Even if I don't know what to do about it.
