# Chapter 8: Not What He Expected

Mid-July, and the section of fence I destroyed doesn't exist anymore. Not in the way it did when I crashed through it. Now it's all new posts, new rails, fresh white paint. You'd never know there'd been an accident there except for the fact that this thirty-foot section looks newer than everything around it.

But we're not working on fences today. We're in the barn, and I'm helping Claire organize the hay storage while Tom Henderson works the far fields.

"Hand me that twine," Claire says from up in the loft.

I grab the spool and toss it up to her. She catches it one-handed without looking, which shouldn't impress me but does.

"Thanks. How's it looking down there?"

"Like a lot of hay that needs stacking."

"Helpful observation," she calls down, and I can hear the amusement in her voice.

We work in companionable silence for a while, the kind we've settled into over the past month. It's strange how silence used to feel like judgment—my father's angry silence, teachers' disappointed silence, the whole town's condemning silence. But silence with Claire just feels like... working. Two people focused on a task that doesn't need words.

My mind drifts while I'm moving hay bales, thinking about how different this summer has turned out from what I expected. I thought I'd be miserable every second. Thought I'd spend three months counting down days and resenting every minute.

But I'm not.

Don't get me wrong—it's still hard work. My muscles still ache at the end of every day. I'm still here because I don't have a choice, not because I want to be.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped feeling like punishment and started feeling like... something else.

Bobby showed up at my house last night, wanting to hang out like we used to. Wanted to go to the diner, maybe race later, the usual Friday night stuff. But I was too tired from a week of work, and honestly, I wasn't interested.

"Man, you've changed," Bobby said, leaning against his car. "It's like you've gone soft or something. Playing farmer all summer with that girl."

"I'm working off a debt," I told him. "That's all."

"Yeah, but you're different. You don't come around anymore. Don't hang out. It's like you'd rather be digging ditches on that farm than spending time with your friends."

I didn't know what to say to that because part of me wondered if he was right. Not about going soft—I still get angry, still have that rage simmering under the surface. But about preferring the farm.

Not the work itself. But something about it. Something I couldn't explain to Bobby without sounding crazy.

"I'm tired," I said instead. "Working twelve-hour days six days a week. By the time I get home, I just want to sleep."

"For two more months," Bobby reminded me. "Two more months of this. What are you gonna do then?"

Good question. I haven't thought much about what happens when summer ends. Haven't let myself think about it.

"Rick?" Claire's voice pulls me back to the present. "You zoning out down there?"

"Just thinking."

"About?"

"Bobby stopped by last night. Thinks I've gone soft spending my summer here."

Claire climbs down the loft ladder, dusting hay off her jeans. "Have you?"

"I don't know. Maybe. I used to be angry all the time. Now I'm just... tired."

"Tired isn't soft." She grabs a hay bale and starts stacking. "Tired is honest. You're working hard. That's something to be tired from."

"Bobby doesn't see it that way. He thinks I should still want to race every weekend. Still want to hang around doing nothing."

"Do you want that?"

I think about it—really think about it. "Not as much as I used to. The racing was about feeling in control. But working here..." I trail off, not sure how to finish.

"But working here, you're actually building something instead of just going fast in circles," Claire finishes for me.

"Yeah. Something like that."

We work side by side for a while, and I'm aware of how natural this feels. How we've developed this rhythm where we don't need to talk about every little thing. She knows what needs doing, I know how to do it, and we just... work.

Around noon, we take our usual break under the oak tree. Claire's been packing extra lunch for a couple weeks now—never making a big deal of it, just opening her lunchbox and handing me a sandwich like it's the most natural thing in the world.

Today she's also got cold lemonade in a jar and some kind of cookies her mother made.

"Your mother knows you're feeding me," I say. It's not a question.

"She insists on it. Says no one should work this hard on half a lunch." Claire hands me a sandwich. "Besides, you're helping with farm work that needed doing anyway. My father's been putting off half this stuff for months."

"So I'm actually useful."

"Don't let it go to your head."

But she's smiling when she says it, and I find myself smiling back.

We eat in the shade, and Claire starts telling me about the letter she got from Michigan State. Even though her father said no to her going, she wrote to them anyway asking about their agricultural program. They sent back information about classes, new farming techniques, soil science.

"Listen to this," she says, pulling out a folded paper from her pocket. "They have a whole course on modern irrigation systems. How to maximize water efficiency, reduce waste, increase crop yields. That's exactly what this farm needs."

The excitement in her voice when she talks about it makes her sound younger, more open. Her eyes light up and she gestures with her sandwich, making points about crop rotation and nitrogen levels in soil.

I don't understand half of what she's talking about, but I like listening to her explain it anyway.

"You really love this stuff," I say.

"Of course I do. It's fascinating. Plants aren't just plants—they're these complex systems that respond to soil conditions, water, light, temperature. If you understand the systems, you can optimize everything. Make things grow better, stronger, more resistant to disease."

"You sound like me talking about engines."

She pauses, considers that. "I guess I do. Same principle, really. Understanding how something works so you can make it better."

"Except your father won't let you learn more about it."

Her enthusiasm dims a little. "He thinks I know enough already. That practical experience is better than book learning."

"But you want both."

"I want both," she agrees. "I want to know why things work, not just that they work. Want to understand the science behind it so I can innovate instead of just maintaining what's already here."

"Like me wanting to understand engine timing and fuel mixture instead of just knowing how to change oil."

"Exactly like that."

We're quiet for a minute, both of us thinking about the things we want to build and the obstacles in our way.

"You should go," I say finally. "To Michigan State. Even if your father says no."

"I can't afford it without his help. The scholarship covers tuition but not room and board. And I'd need his permission anyway—I'm only sixteen."

"But next year you'll be seventeen. Year after that, eighteen. Then you can make your own choices."

"Two more years." She says it like it's a lifetime.

"Two more years and you can do whatever you want. Build whatever you want. Show your father what you're capable of."

Claire looks at me, something shifting in her expression. "You really think I should go."

"I think you're smart enough that not going would be a waste. And I think you'd be good at it. Better than good."

"That might be the nicest thing you've said to me all summer."

"Don't let it go to your head," I echo her earlier words, and she laughs.

Actually laughs—not just a smile but a real, genuine laugh that makes her whole face change. Makes her look free instead of serious, young instead of responsible.

And I realize I made her laugh. That something I said brought out that sound.

The thought makes my chest feel weird. Tight but not in a bad way. More like something's expanding in there, taking up space it didn't have before.

"What?" Claire asks, catching me staring.

"Nothing. Just... I don't think I've heard you laugh before."

"I laugh."

"Not around me you don't."

"Around you I'm usually trying to keep you from murdering fence posts or throwing toolboxes."

"Fair point."

We finish our lunch, and when we head back to the barn, something feels different. Lighter, maybe. Like something shifted during that conversation and neither of us is quite sure what it means yet.

The afternoon passes in more companionable work. Claire tells me more about the agricultural program, and I tell her about the engine modifications I want to make to the Chevy eventually. We argue good-naturedly about whether farming or mechanics is more complex (she says farming, I say engines, we agree to disagree).

At some point I realize I've been looking forward to these conversations. Looking forward to the lunch breaks where we talk about things that aren't just work. Looking forward to the way Claire explains soil science with the same passion I feel about camshafts.

Looking forward to being around her.

That thought stops me mid-sentence, and Claire notices.

"You okay?"

"Yeah. Just... thinking."

"About?"

About how this summer was supposed to be punishment but somewhere along the way it turned into something else. About how I was supposed to resent every minute here but instead I find myself not wanting days to end. About how Claire Henderson was supposed to be the person making sure I paid for my mistakes but instead she's become...

What? A friend?

More than that?

"Nothing important," I say, because I don't have words for what I'm actually thinking.

But Claire gives me that look—the one that says she knows I'm not telling the whole truth but she's not going to push.

When we finish for the day and I'm driving home, I catch myself already thinking about Monday morning. About what we'll work on next, what Claire will pack for lunch, what we'll talk about during breaks.

Bobby thinks I've gone soft.

Maybe he's right.

Or maybe I've just found something—someone—worth being less angry around.

Either way, this summer is not what I expected.

And that's not entirely a bad thing.
