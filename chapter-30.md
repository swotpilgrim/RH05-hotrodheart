# Chapter 30: The Future

Sunday morning I wake up with butterflies in my stomach.

Today I have to face Tom Henderson knowing I kissed his daughter and told her I love her.

I get dressed slowly. My father's passed out on the couch as usual. I step over him and head out to the Chevy.

The drive to the Henderson farm feels both too long and too short.

When I pull into the farmyard, Tom Henderson is already there. Waiting. Standing by the barn with his arms crossed, his expression unreadable.

This is it.

I walk over to him, trying to keep my breathing steady.

"Morning, sir."

"Rick." He nods. "We need to talk."

I brace for the worst.

"I've been thinking about this summer," Henderson says. "About the work you've done here. About the changes I've seen in you."

"Sir—"

He holds up a hand. "Let me finish."

I close my mouth.

"When I made you that deal back in June, I figured I'd get some half-hearted labor from a kid who resented being here. Maybe teach you something about consequences. Maybe get my fence fixed." He pauses. "But you exceeded every expectation I had."

I don't know where he's going with this.

"You showed up every morning. Worked hard. Learned fast. Proved you're more than just a troublemaker from the wrong side of town." Henderson pulls off his hat, runs a hand through his hair. "You proved you're someone who keeps his word. Someone who can be counted on. Someone who wants to be better than the life he was given."

My chest is tight.

"So I want to offer you a job," Henderson says. "Part-time during the school year, full-time next summer. Real pay this time."

I stare at him. "You want me to keep working here?"

"I do. You proved you're someone who makes good choices even when they're hard. That's exactly the kind of person I want working on my farm."

I don't know what to say. I came here expecting to be fired, expecting to be told to stay away from Claire, expecting consequences for falling in love with a girl who's too good for me.

Instead, Tom Henderson is offering me a future.

"I don't know if I can accept," I say carefully.

Henderson raises an eyebrow. "Why not?"

"Because..." I take a breath. "Because I need to be honest with you about something. About Claire."

"I know."

"You... know?"

"I'm not blind, Rick. I've been watching you two all summer. Seen the way you look at her. The way she looks at you." Henderson crosses his arms again. "I figured it was only a matter of time before one of you said something."

Oh.

"So you know that I..." I can't quite finish the sentence.

"That you have feelings for my daughter?" Henderson finishes. "Yes. And that she has feelings for you? Also yes. Noticed that about a month ago."

A month ago. Before I even admitted it to myself.

"Are you angry?" I ask.

Henderson considers this. "Not angry. Concerned, maybe. Protective. She's my daughter, and you're... well. You're someone with a complicated history."

"I know, sir. And I understand if you think I'm not good enough for her—"

"I didn't say that."

I stop.

"I said you have a complicated history," Henderson clarifies. "That's different from not being good enough. Everyone has history, Rick. Everyone makes mistakes. What matters is what you do with it. Whether you learn from it. Whether you choose to be better."

He looks at me steadily.

"And you've been choosing to be better all summer. That's why I'm not running you off my property with a shotgun like some fathers might."

The joke—if it is a joke—makes me breathe a little easier.

"But," Henderson continues, and his voice is serious now, "if you're serious about my daughter, I have expectations."

"Yes, sir."

"I expect you to treat her right. To respect her. To support her goals and dreams, not try to change them or hold her back."

"I would never—"

"I expect you to finish school. To work hard. To keep proving you're the man I think you can be."

"I will, sir. I promise."

"And I expect you to understand that she's got a bright future ahead of her. She's going to college, Rick. She's going to do great things. If you love her, you'll encourage that, even if it means she's not always here."

The words hit harder than I expected. Claire going away to college. Claire having opportunities and dreams that might take her away from Pine Valley. Away from me.

But Henderson's right. If I love her—and I do—I need to support her dreams, not hold her back just because I'm scared of losing her.

"I understand," I say. "And I'll support her. Whatever she wants to do. Wherever she wants to go."

Henderson studies me for a long moment, then nods.

"All right then. Think about it. Let me know by end of week."

"I don't need to think about it. Yes. I accept. Thank you, sir."

"Good."

Henderson excuses himself to check on the barn, and I'm left standing in the farmyard trying to process what just happened.

That's when Claire appears on the porch.

She's wearing a yellow dress, her hair down, and she's smiling at me like I'm the only person in the world that matters.

I walk over to her. Can't help the grin spreading across my face.

"How much did you hear?" I ask.

"All of it. I was listening from the window."

"Of course you were."

She comes down the porch steps and takes my hands. "He offered you a job."

"He did."

"And you accepted."

"I did."

"Good." She squeezes my hands. "Because I wasn't ready for this summer to be the end of us."

"Me neither."

We stand there in the morning sun, and I realize something. This is real. This future Henderson is offering me, this relationship with Claire, this possibility of being someone different—it's all real.

"He mentioned college," I say quietly. "Said you're going to do great things. He's right."

Claire looks at me carefully. "And that doesn't scare you?"

"Terrifies me," I admit. "The thought of you leaving. Going somewhere I can't follow. Having opportunities I can't be part of. But..." I squeeze her hands back. "I meant what I said last night. I want you to have everything you want. Even if it means you're not always here."

"I'm reapplying to Michigan State," Claire says. "This time I'm going to fight harder. Make my father understand that this is what I want."

"Good."

"It's in East Lansing. Three hours away."

"I know."

"If I get in, I'll be gone most of the year."

"I know."

"And that's okay with you?"

I think about it. Really think about it. About Claire leaving for college. About me staying here in Pine Valley, working at the farm and the garage, building my life one day at a time.

It's not ideal. I'd rather have her here all the time.

But Henderson was right. If I love her, I support her dreams.

"It's okay with me," I say. "We'll figure it out. Letters. Phone calls. Summer breaks. Whatever it takes."

Claire smiles. "What about you? What do you want?"

"I want to work," I say. "Save money. Figure out who I am when I'm not just reacting to my father or my reputation. Maybe take some classes at the community college. Learn more about engines, about mechanics. See if I can turn it into something more than just working at a garage."

It's the first time I've said it out loud. The first time I've let myself think about a future beyond just surviving.

"That sounds good," Claire says.

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. It sounds like you're building something."

Building something. Not destroying. Building.

"We'll face the town together," I say. "People are going to talk about us. About the Dalton kid and the Henderson girl. About how you could do better. About how I'm no good for you."

"Let them talk," Claire says. "I know who you are. You know who you are. That's what matters."

She's right.

Eventually I have to go. My shift at the garage starts soon.

"I'll see you tomorrow?" Claire asks.

"Yeah. Monday morning."

She kisses me goodbye, and it's still perfect. Still fills up that empty space in my chest. Still makes me believe I'm worth something.

I climb into my Chevy and start the engine. Claire waves from the porch, and I wave back before pulling out of the farmyard.

As I drive away, I look at the farm in my rearview mirror. The barn where I've stored my tools all summer. The fields where I've learned to work with my hands. The porch where Claire is still standing, watching me go.

This place changed me.

Claire changed me.

I'm not the same Rick Dalton who crashed through that fence in June. I'm not the angry kid who solved everything with speed and violence.

I'm someone who builds instead of destroys. Someone who breathes instead of explodes. Someone who chooses, every day, to be better.

I'm not running away from anything anymore.

I'm building toward something. Toward a future I'm creating one choice at a time.

The road ahead isn't clear. I don't have all the answers.

But I know this: I'm not facing any of it alone.

I have Claire. I have Tom Henderson's faith. I have a job and a future and proof that I can change.

I have my calm.

And her name is Claire Henderson.

I drive through town in the Sunday morning quiet, past the fairgrounds, past Murphy's Diner, past all the familiar places that make up Pine Valley.

This town used to feel like a prison.

But now it feels like home.

And for the first time in seventeen years, I'm not angry about that.

I'm at peace.

I pull into my driveway and get out of the Chevy. I look at this car I built from scrap metal—this car that represents everything I'm capable of when I don't give up.

I almost destroyed it yesterday. But Claire stopped me. Reminded me that building something good is the proof.

I'm building myself the same way. One day at a time. One choice at a time.

It's the hardest thing I've ever done.

But it's worth it.

Because I'm not just the hothead from the wrong side of town anymore.

I'm Rick Dalton.

And I'm building something better.
