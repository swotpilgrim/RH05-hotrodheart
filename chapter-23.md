# Chapter 23: Falling Apart

Claire leaves a few minutes later. Says her mother's expecting her for supper, asks if I'll be back tomorrow.

I tell her yes. I'll be back.

She squeezes my arm one more time, gives me a small smile, and walks out of the barn into the evening light.

And I'm alone.

I stand there in the tack room for a long moment, not moving, barely breathing. The dust motes are still floating in the last shafts of sunlight. The barn still smells like hay and leather. Nothing's changed.

Except everything has changed.

I sink down onto the hay bale where Claire was sitting. My legs just give out, and suddenly I'm sitting there in the dim barn with my head in my hands and my chest so tight I can't breathe.

She's not giving up on me.

After everything she saw—after I proved every terrible thing people think about the Daltons, after I showed her the violence and rage that lives under my skin—she's not giving up.

She still believes I can be better.

The thought breaks something open inside me. Something I've been holding onto so tightly for so long that I forgot it was there.

And for the first time since my mother left five years ago, I cry.

Not the angry tears of a kid who's been hurt. Not the frustrated tears of someone who can't fix what's broken. Just... crying. Deep, wrenching sobs that come from somewhere in my chest I didn't know existed.

I cry for the summer I almost lost. For the progress I thought I'd destroyed. For the fear that I'd proven myself worthless and alone.

I cry for my mother, who left because she couldn't stand what our family had become. Who probably looks at me and sees my father and knows she was right to run.

I cry for every morning I've woken up scared that I'd end up drunk and bitter like Frank Dalton. For every fight I've gotten into because I didn't know how else to handle the rage. For every person who's looked at me and seen nothing but trouble.

I cry because I'm seventeen years old and I'm so tired of being angry all the time.

And I cry because Claire Henderson looked at me with my father's blood on my hands and told me I'm worth fighting for.

It's too much. All of it. Too much fear and hope and exhaustion and desperate, terrifying want.

I've spent my whole life building walls. Staying angry so I wouldn't get hurt. Keeping everyone at arm's length because if they can't get close, they can't leave. If I don't care about anything, I can't lose anything.

But Claire walked right through all of it.

She saw me punch a fence post and asked what I was really angry about. She worked beside me all summer and taught me to breathe instead of explode. She watched me beat my own father and told me I'm not him.

She believes in me.

And I have absolutely no idea what to do with that.

The crying slows eventually. Tapers off into shaky breaths and the occasional hiccup. I wipe my face with my sleeve, feeling like an idiot. Seventeen-year-old guys don't sit in barns and cry like kids.

But maybe that's part of the problem. Maybe I've been so busy trying to be tough, trying to prove I'm not weak, that I forgot it's okay to actually feel things.

Claire feels things. She gets angry at her father for not taking her seriously. She gets frustrated with the town's expectations. She gets sad when things don't work out the way she hoped.

But she doesn't let it eat her alive. Doesn't let it turn her into someone bitter and angry.

She channels it. Uses it. Becomes stronger because of it, not in spite of it.

Maybe I can do that too.

Maybe that's what Henderson meant when he said I have to choose every single day. Not choose whether to feel angry—that's automatic, that's just being human. But choose what I do with the anger. Choose whether I let it control me or whether I control it.

Choose to breathe instead of explode. To count instead of swing. To fix what's broken instead of breaking more things.

It sounds exhausting when I put it like that.

But Claire said I'm not doing it alone.

She said that. Actually said it out loud, in the barn, looking right at me.

*You're not doing it alone.*

I lean back against the barn wall and close my eyes. My ribs still ache. My knuckles are still scabbed and bruised. My face still looks like I've been in a bar fight.

But something in my chest feels lighter than it has in days.

Claire's not scared of me. She's not giving up. She still sees something in me worth believing in.

And if she can see it, maybe it's actually there. Maybe I'm not just Frank Dalton's son destined to repeat every mistake he's ever made. Maybe I'm Rick Dalton, and I get to decide who that means.

The thought is terrifying.

I've spent seventeen years knowing exactly who I am: the town hothead, the troublemaker, the kid from the wrong side with a drunk father and no future. It's a terrible identity, but it's familiar. Safe, in its own awful way.

If I'm not that anymore, then who am I?

The answer comes quietly, almost like Claire's voice in my head:

*You're someone who rebuilds cars from scrap metal. Someone who works all summer to pay his debts. Someone who learns to breathe through anger. Someone who cares so much he's terrified of letting people down.*

Someone who made Claire Henderson believe in him.

Someone who's trying, every single day, to be better than the life he was given.

That's who I am.

Or at least, that's who I'm trying to become.

I open my eyes and look around the barn. This place has been my second home all summer. I've stored my tools here, fixed equipment here, hidden from the midday heat in the cool shadows.

And now I've fallen apart here, in the same tack room where Claire told me she's not giving up on me.

Maybe that's fitting.

Maybe you have to fall apart before you can build yourself back up. Maybe you have to cry out all the fear and exhaustion before you can figure out who you actually want to be.

I pull myself to my feet slowly. Everything still hurts, but it's manageable. I've had worse.

I've survived worse.

And I'll survive this too.

I'll go home tonight to my run-down house and my drunk father. I'll lie in bed and try to sleep despite the aches and pains. And tomorrow morning I'll wake up at five and drive back to this farm.

Not because Tom Henderson is making me. Not because I'm fulfilling some deal.

But because I want to.

Because I want to prove that I can keep my word. That I can finish what I started. That one bad moment doesn't define who I am or who I can become.

Because I want to see Claire and show her that her belief in me wasn't misplaced.

Because I want to be the person she sees when she looks at me—someone worth fighting for, someone worth believing in.

I want to be worthy of her.

And if that means showing up every morning and choosing to be better, choosing to breathe instead of explode, choosing to build instead of destroy—then that's what I'll do.

For Claire.

For Tom Henderson, who gave me a second chance when everyone else just wanted to lock me up.

For myself, because I'm so damn tired of being angry and alone.

I pick up my toolbox and head out of the barn. The sun's setting now, painting the fields gold and orange. It's beautiful in a way I never noticed before this summer. Before I learned to slow down and actually look at things instead of just racing past them.

My Chevy's parked where I left it this morning. The car I built from scrap metal when I was fifteen because I needed to prove I could create something good.

I did that once. Built something from nothing.

Maybe I can do it again.

Maybe I can take the broken, angry kid I've always been and build something better. Something stronger. Someone who doesn't have to be defined by his father's mistakes or his town's judgment.

Someone who chooses, every single day, to be better.

It won't be easy. I'll fail sometimes. I'll lose my temper or say the wrong thing or prove that I've still got a long way to go.

But I'll get up the next day and try again.

Because that's what Claire said: you keep trying. Even when you fail. Even when you mess up.

You get up and try again.

I can do that.

I have to do that.

Because for the first time in my life, I have something worth fighting for. Something worth being better for.

I have hope.

And I'm not going to let it go.
