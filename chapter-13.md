# Chapter 13: Shifting Feelings

Six weeks into summer, and the Henderson farm doesn't look the same as it did when I arrived.

The fence I crashed through is long repaired—fresh white paint, straight rails, solid posts. The garden I destroyed is flourishing again, neat rows of vegetables that Claire tends every morning and evening. The work we've done is everywhere I look: reinforced barn structures, cleared irrigation ditches, replaced fence sections, repainted outbuildings.

Tom Henderson has started trusting me with more complex work. Yesterday he had me completely overhaul the irrigation pump system—diagnosing problems, replacing worn parts, getting everything running smooth again. Today I'm reinforcing the barn's support beams, work that requires precision and attention to detail.

"Good work on the pump," Henderson said this morning when he checked my repairs. "Runs better than it has in years. You've got a real skill for mechanical systems."

The praise should have felt hollow, coming from the man whose property I destroyed. But it doesn't. I'm actually proud of the work I've done here. Proud of fixing things instead of breaking them.

And that's strange enough on its own. But what's stranger is that it's not just the work I'm proud of.

It's being around Claire.

I notice her more now than I did those first weeks. Not just that she's there—I couldn't help noticing that from day one. But I notice details. Small things that shouldn't matter but somehow do.

The way her hair always escapes her braid by midmorning, strands falling loose around her face that she tucks behind her ear without thinking. The way she bites her bottom lip when she's concentrating on something, eyes narrowed in focus. The way she moves through farm work with this easy confidence, like she's part of the land instead of just working on it.

The way she laughs at my stupid jokes, head thrown back, genuinely amused instead of just being polite.

I catch myself watching her when I should be working. Watching the way she handles tools, the way she explains things, the way she pushes her sleeves up when the heat gets intense. And I realize I'm watching her the same way I watch engine parts—trying to understand how all the pieces fit together, what makes everything work.

Except Claire's not an engine I can take apart and rebuild.

She's a person. A girl. A Henderson.

And I'm falling for her.

The realization hits me Wednesday afternoon while we're working on the barn reinforcement. Claire's holding a support beam in place while I secure it, and the sunlight coming through the barn door catches her hair, turns it golden-brown. She's explaining her father's plans for expanding the hay storage, voice animated, hands gesturing even though she's supposed to be holding the beam steady.

And I think: I want to listen to her talk about hay storage for the rest of my life.

That thought should terrify me.

It does terrify me.

Because there's no version of this that ends well.

She's Claire Henderson—smart, capable, daughter of a successful farmer, someone with plans and dreams and a scholarship to Michigan State if she can ever convince her father to let her go. She's going places.

I'm Rick Dalton—son of the town drunk, the hothead who crashed through her fence, the kid everyone expects to end up just like his old man. I'm going nowhere.

We're from different worlds that happen to share the same small town. And once summer ends, once I've worked off my debt, those worlds will separate again.

But knowing that doesn't make me want her less.

If anything, it makes it worse.

Thursday morning, I pull up to the farm and Claire's already at the tool shed. She looks up, sees me, and smiles. Just a small smile, nothing special. But it hits me like a physical thing, warm in my chest.

"Morning," she says, handing me work gloves. "We're checking fence posts in the east pasture today. Long walk, but my mother packed extra sandwiches."

"Sounds good."

And it does sound good. Not because I particularly care about fence posts or extra sandwiches, but because it's a whole day working beside Claire. Talking with her. Being around her.

That's the problem right there.

I look forward to seeing her every morning. Drive to the farm thinking about what we'll work on, what we'll talk about during lunch, whether I can make her laugh. Come home every night thinking about tomorrow.

This is dangerous territory. The kind I should back away from before I get in too deep.

Except I'm already in too deep.

We spend the day walking the east pasture fence line, checking for rot and weakness. It's hot work, but the pasture is beautiful—rolling hills, wildflowers scattered through the grass, occasional shade from oak trees. Claire knows every inch of it, points out where deer cross regularly, where the soil shifts in heavy rain, where her grandfather planted trees when her father was a boy.

She loves this land. It's in every word she says, every gesture she makes.

And I find myself loving that she loves it. Loving the passion in her voice when she talks about crop rotation and soil management. Loving the way her eyes light up when she explains irrigation efficiency.

I've got it bad.

At lunch we sit under one of the old oaks, and Claire unpacks sandwiches and lemonade. We eat in comfortable silence for a while, and I'm hyperaware of how close we're sitting. Our shoulders almost touching. Close enough that I can smell the lavender soap she uses.

"Rick?" Claire says.

"Yeah?"

"You okay? You've been quiet today."

"Just thinking."

"About?"

About you. About how much I like being here. About how scared I am that I'm starting to care too much.

"Nothing important," I say instead. "Just tired."

She doesn't look convinced but doesn't push. Just hands me another sandwich and goes back to eating.

And I wonder if she notices the way I look at her. If she sees what's happening. If maybe—and this is the dangerous thought—if maybe she feels it too.

But that's stupid. Why would Claire Henderson be interested in me? She sees me as a project, maybe. Someone who needed fixing like the fence posts and irrigation systems. Someone who's worked hard enough to earn basic respect.

Not someone to care about. Not like that.

We finish lunch and keep working. The afternoon passes in more fence checking, more walking, more being close but not close enough. And by the time we call it a day, I'm exhausted and confused and wishing I could just turn off whatever this feeling is.

That night, I lie awake in my bedroom staring at the ceiling.

The house is quiet except for my father's snoring from down the hall. The room is shabby—peeling paint, cracked plaster, second-hand furniture that's older than I am. Everything about my life is shabby compared to Claire's.

I think about the Henderson farmhouse. Clean. Organized. Warm. Mrs. Henderson making pot roast for dinner. Tom Henderson talking about crop yields. Claire sharing her day, being listened to, being part of something solid.

That's not my life. Never will be.

My life is this room, this house, this reputation. I can leave Pine Valley, start over in Detroit, build something new. But that doesn't change where I came from. Doesn't change that I'm Frank Dalton's kid.

And Claire deserves better than Frank Dalton's kid.

She deserves someone who's going somewhere. Someone without anger issues and a drunk father and a history of making bad choices. Someone who can give her the life she wants without dragging her down.

I should stop this before it goes any further.

Should keep my distance. Stop watching her so closely. Stop looking forward to every morning. Stop caring about the way she laughs or the way her hair escapes her braid or the way she explains soil science like it's the most fascinating thing in the world.

Should protect her from me, from the disaster I'd inevitably become in her life.

Should. Should. Should.

But lying here in the dark, all I can think about is tomorrow morning. Pulling up to the farm. Seeing Claire at the tool shed. Her small smile when she hands me work gloves. The whole day ahead of us.

I'm falling for Claire Henderson, and there's not a damn thing I can do to stop it.

Tried talking myself out of it. Listing all the reasons it's impossible, all the ways it would go wrong, all the evidence that she's too good for me.

But none of that changes how I feel.

How she makes me feel like I'm worth something. Like I'm more than my father's son. Like I could be the person I want to be instead of the person everyone expects.

She sees me differently than anyone else ever has. And once you've been seen like that, really seen, you can't go back to being invisible.

So yeah, I'm falling for her.

And it's terrifying.

And it's probably going to end badly.

But I wake up tomorrow morning, and I'm going to drive to the Henderson farm. Going to work beside Claire all day. Going to talk with her and laugh with her and try not to let on how much I'm starting to need her.

Because the alternative—staying away, protecting her from me, doing the "right thing"—would hurt worse than any crash I could walk away from.

At least for now, I get to be near her. Get to see her smile. Get to pretend that maybe, somehow, this could be something real.

Even if I know better.

Even if it's hopeless.

I'm falling for Claire Henderson.

And there's no walking away from that now.
