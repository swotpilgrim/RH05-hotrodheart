# Chapter 9: When the Anger Comes

I wake up Wednesday morning with my jaw clenched and my hands in fists.

The anger's been building since last night, coiled tight in my chest.

My father came home drunk. Again.

Usually he just passes out. But last night he was in that mean, talkative stage where everything wrong with his life becomes my fault.

I came in from the Henderson farm around seven-thirty, tired and ready to sleep. Found him in the kitchen, swaying with a half-empty bottle.

"Look at you," he slurred. "Coming home all proud. Think you're better than me now, don't you? Working for the rich Hendersons like some kind of charity case."

I didn't respond. Responding just makes it worse.

"Too good to talk to your own father." He stumbled toward me, breath reeking. "Think that Henderson girl is gonna see you as anything but trash."

I kept my mouth shut, kept my hands unclenched, kept breathing.

"You're just like me," he said, voice dropping to something uglier. "You got my blood. Sooner or later, you're gonna end up right here, right where I am, because that's all we ever amount to."

I walked past him to my room. Closed the door. Listened to him yell for twenty minutes before he passed out.

But his words stayed with me. Kept me awake half the night.

*You're just like me.*

Some part of me—the scared, angry part—wonders if he's right. Wonders if all this trying to be better is just temporary.

I get dressed for work, moving on automatic. My reflection shows dark circles, jaw tight, hands shaking.

But I made a promise to show up, so I show up.

When I pull up, Claire's already at the tool shed. She looks up as I park, and her expression changes. She knows when I'm in a bad place.

I grab my gloves and walk over, not trusting myself to speak.

"North fence line today," Claire says, voice careful. "We need to replace some rotted posts."

I nod, grab the sledgehammer and posthole digger.

We walk to the north fence in silence. Claire's giving me space. But the anger is still there, simmering, building.

The first post is obviously rotted. Claire points it out, and I set to work with the sledgehammer.

I swing the hammer. It connects. The impact jars up my arms. I swing again. And again.

"That one's loose," Claire says. "You can pull it now."

But I keep swinging. Harder. The post is already compromised, but I keep hitting it. Need to hit something. Need to channel this rage somewhere.

"Rick." Claire's voice, still calm. "It's ready."

I stop, breathing hard, and pull the post out. Toss it aside harder than necessary.

The next post takes longer. We have to dig around it first. I grab the shovel and start digging. Stabbing at the ground. Every thrust too hard, too forceful.

Claire watches but doesn't say anything. Just starts digging on the other side.

Once the post is exposed, I grab the sledgehammer again. Should be careful, controlled hits.

I'm not careful.

I swing hard. The hammer connects with the post and bounces back, the reverberation making my hands sting. I swing again, harder. Miss the post entirely and hit the ground, sending dirt flying. Frustration flares hot in my chest.

"Damn it."

I swing again. This time I hit the post but at the wrong angle. The hammer rebounds. The post doesn't budge.

And something in me just breaks.

All the control I've been holding onto—all morning, all night, all summer—snaps.

I throw the sledgehammer. It flies about ten feet and hits the ground. Then I kick the post hard with my boot. The post doesn't move. My foot hurts.

I punch the post with my bare hand.

The pain is immediate and sharp. I punch it again. Knuckles connecting with rough wood. Splinters driving in. Blood welling up.

I'm breathing hard, hands shaking, blood on the fence post, and I can't stop.

"Rick."

Claire's voice, but I don't look at her. Can't. I'm too far gone, too angry, too full of rage that has nowhere to go.

I pull back to punch the post again.

"Rick, stop."

I don't stop. Can't stop. My hand's already bleeding and I know I should stop but the rage is bigger than logic right now.

Then Claire's there. Between me and the post. Not touching me, just standing there, hands at her sides, looking at me with calm eyes.

Not scared. Not angry. Just waiting.

My fist is pulled back. She's directly in my way. If I swing, I'll hit her.

I won't swing. I would never. But the fact that she's standing there, trusting I won't, breaks through the red haze enough that I can lower my hand.

I'm shaking. My knuckles are bleeding. I can feel splinters in my skin.

"What are you really angry about, Rick?"

Her voice is quiet. Not accusing. Not judging. Just asking.

I can't answer. Don't have words for it. Or too many words tangled up with years of fear and resentment and the crushing weight of being Frank Dalton's son.

"Talk to me," Claire says. "Tell me what's really going on."

"It's nothing." My voice comes out harsh. "Just having a bad morning."

"This isn't a bad morning. This is something else."

She's right.

I look down at my bleeding knuckles, at the blood on the fence post. Another thing I broke because I couldn't control my temper.

"My father," I start, then stop.

"What about him?"

"He was drunk last night. Started yelling about how I think I'm better than him. How I'm wasting my time trying to be different because I'm just like him. How it's in my blood and I can't change it."

The words come out flat. Like I'm reporting facts instead of repeating the things that kept me up all night.

Claire's quiet for a moment. "Do you believe him?"

"I don't want to."

"That's not what I asked."

I look at her finally. She's still standing close, still watching me with that steady gaze.

"Sometimes," I admit. "When I lose it like this. When I can't control the anger. Yeah, sometimes I think he's right."

"You're not."

"How do you know?" The question comes out sharper than I mean. "You barely know me, Claire. You know me here, doing work, keeping it together most of the time. But you don't know what I'm like when I'm not here. Don't know what's in my head."

"I know you're not your father," she says firmly. "Because your father wouldn't care. Wouldn't worry about being like him. Wouldn't try to be better."

"Trying doesn't mean succeeding."

"No. But trying means you're different. Your father doesn't try. He just is what he is. But you fight it every day. That makes you different."

I want to believe her.

"Look at your hand," Claire says.

I look down. My knuckles are bleeding, starting to swell.

"You punched a fence post because you were angry. That's the action. But what were you really trying to hit?"

"I don't know. Everything. The fact that no matter what I do, I'm still the Dalton kid from the wrong side of town with a drunk father and a reputation."

"Were you trying to hit me?"

"What? No. Never."

"Then you have control. Even in the middle of losing it, you had enough control not to hurt someone who didn't deserve it. That's not your father. That's you choosing, even when you're angry."

I hadn't thought about it that way.

"Come here," Claire says, and walks toward the water jug we keep in the shade.

I follow, still shaking slightly. She pours water over my bleeding knuckles, and I hiss at the sting. She pulls a clean bandana from her pocket and wraps it around my hand.

"You're going to have splinters. We'll need to pull them out. But first, you're going to sit down and breathe."

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. Sit."

I sit. Because Claire's right—I'm not fine. I'm angry and scared and exhausted from fighting battles I can't seem to win.

She sits next to me, hands folded in her lap, and we're quiet for a long minute.

"My dad used to get angry," she says finally. "When I was little. Not at me, usually. At the weather, at crop failures, at prices falling. Farming is unpredictable. He'd yell. Throw things sometimes. Punch walls."

I look at her, surprised. Tom Henderson seems so calm.

"He doesn't anymore," Claire continues. "Took him years, but he learned to channel it differently. Into work, into planning, into solving problems instead of reacting. Because he chose to. Because my mother told him he had to if he wanted us to feel safe around him."

"So you're saying I need to just... choose not to be angry?"

"No. I'm saying you need to find better ways to handle the anger. Because it's not going away. It's part of you. But it doesn't have to control you."

"How?"

"Work helps. Talking helps. Knowing what's really making you angry instead of just hitting the nearest thing."

She's looking at me now, and there's something soft in her expression. Understanding, maybe.

"You're not your father, Rick," she says again. "But you have to believe that yourself. I can't make you believe it."

I look down at my wrapped hand. At the blood seeping through the bandana.

"I'm trying," I say quietly. "I'm really trying."

"I know you are. I see it every day."

And that helps. Just knowing someone sees the effort, even when it doesn't feel like enough.

We sit in the shade for a while longer, and slowly, the anger drains out of me. Leaves me empty and tired but calmer.

"Ready to get back to work?" Claire asks eventually.

"Yeah. But maybe I should use the shovel instead of the sledgehammer."

"Probably a good idea."

We stand up, head back to the fence. And when I start digging around the next post, Claire works beside me like nothing happened. Like I didn't just lose control and prove I'm exactly what I'm afraid of being.

But I didn't hit her. And I stopped. And I'm trying.

Maybe that's enough for today.
