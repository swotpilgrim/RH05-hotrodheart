# Chapter 22: She Finds Him

I work all day Thursday without seeing Claire.

Henderson mentioned at mid-morning that she's helping her mother in town. Shopping or something. Errands that needed doing.

But I know what it really means.

She doesn't want to see me. Doesn't want to be anywhere near the violent kid who beat his own father bloody in her farmyard. Can't blame her for that.

So I work. Keep my head down, my hands busy, my mouth shut. Henderson and I repair the fence in silence. It's familiar work now—pulling broken rails, setting new posts, making sure everything's level and square.

The same fence. The same work.

Like the whole summer is just a circle, ending where it began.

By evening, when Henderson tells me I can head out, I'm exhausted. The kind of bone-deep tired that comes from physical labor and emotional devastation mixing together.

I should just go home. Shower. Try to sleep even though I know I won't.

But I need to grab my tools from the barn first. The wrenches and hammers I've been using all summer, kept in a wooden box near the tack room.

The barn is dim and cool after the August heat. Dust motes float in the shafts of evening light coming through the gaps in the walls. It smells like hay and leather and work.

I walk to where I keep my toolbox, planning to just grab it and go. Avoid any possibility of running into Claire. Spare her the discomfort of having to face me.

But when I round the corner into the tack room, I stop dead.

Claire's sitting on a hay bale. Waiting.

My stomach drops to my boots.

She's wearing a simple dress, her hair down instead of in its usual work braid. She looks tired. Like maybe she didn't sleep last night either.

"I didn't know you were here," I say, already backing toward the door. "I'll just grab my tools and—"

"Rick." Her voice stops me. "Stay."

"I shouldn't—"

"Please."

The word is quiet, but it hits me hard. I stop moving. Can't make myself leave when she asked like that, even though everything in me is screaming that I need to run before I make this worse.

We stand there in silence for a long moment. I can't make myself look at her. Can't bear to see that frozen, scared expression from yesterday.

"Are you hurt?" she finally asks.

The question is so unexpected that I actually look up. "What?"

"Are you hurt?" she repeats. "Your ribs. Your face. Are you okay?"

I stare at her. Of all the things I expected her to say—accusations, anger, telling me to stay away from her—that wasn't it.

"I'm fine," I manage.

"You're lying."

"Yeah, well." I shrug, and my ribs scream in protest. "I'll live. He got me good with an elbow, but nothing's broken."

Claire nods slowly. "And your hands?"

I look down at my knuckles. They're scabbed over now, bruised and swollen. The same hands that were bleeding all over the farmyard yesterday.

"They're fine," I say.

"Rick—"

"I'm fine, Claire." The words come out harsher than I mean them to. "I'm fine, and I don't deserve you worrying about me after what you saw yesterday, so just... don't. Okay?"

She stands up from the hay bale. Takes a step toward me.

I take a step back.

"What are you doing?" I ask.

"Checking on you."

"You shouldn't." Another step back. "You should be staying as far away from me as possible. You should be scared. You should—"

"I'm not scared of you, Rick."

The words stop me cold.

"You should be," I say. "You saw what I did. You saw me lose control. You saw me turn into exactly what everyone's always said I was—a violent hothead who's just like his drunk father. So don't stand there and tell me you're not scared because I saw your face yesterday, Claire. I saw how you looked at me."

"You saw me scared FOR you," Claire corrects quietly. "Not OF you."

I shake my head. "That doesn't make sense."

"Doesn't it?" She takes another step toward me. I don't move this time. "I watched you all summer learn to control your anger. Watched you breathe through it. Watched you stop and count to ten when everything in you wanted to explode. And then yesterday your father showed up."

Her voice is calm, steady. The same voice she uses when she's explaining something about the farm, patient and certain.

"He showed up drunk," she continues. "He humiliated you in front of my father. He said terrible things about you, about your mother, about me. He pushed every single button you have, Rick. All the buttons he's been installing your whole life. And you lost control."

"Exactly," I say bitterly. "I lost control. I proved all the breathing and counting was useless. I proved I'm exactly what he said I am."

"No." Claire's voice is firm now. "You proved you're human. You proved that when someone hurts you badly enough, you fight back. That's not the same thing as being your father."

I want to believe her. God, I want to believe her so badly.

But I can't.

"You don't understand," I say. "I couldn't stop, Claire. Even when your father was yelling, even when you were telling me to stop, I couldn't. I was on top of him and I just kept hitting him and I couldn't make myself stop."

"But you did stop," she points out.

"Only because your father pulled me off."

"You stopped," she repeats. "You didn't fight my father. You didn't resist when he grabbed you. You stopped."

"That doesn't change what I did."

"No," Claire agrees. "It doesn't. You got in a fight with your father. You lost your temper. It was ugly and violent and I hated watching it. But one bad moment doesn't erase months of progress, Rick. It doesn't mean you're him."

She's close enough now that I can see her eyes clearly. They're not scared. Not frozen. Just sad and worried and somehow still seeing me as something other than the monster I proved myself to be.

"How can you stand here and say that?" I ask, my voice raw. "After what you saw?"

"Because I know you're not him," Claire says simply. "I've spent all summer watching you become someone different. Watching you learn and grow and try so hard to be better. One moment where you failed doesn't undo all of that."

"It does in my head."

"Then your head is wrong."

I actually almost laugh at that. Almost. "My head's telling me I'm exactly what everyone's always said I am. That seems pretty accurate from where I'm standing."

"Everyone's wrong," Claire says firmly. "They see the Dalton name and they stop looking. They see your father and assume that's your future. They don't see you, Rick. They don't see the guy who rebuilt a car from scrap metal because he had to prove to himself he could create something. They don't see the guy who's shown up at this farm every morning for three months even when he was exhausted or angry or wanted to quit. They don't see you."

"But you do?" I can't keep the skepticism out of my voice.

"Yes."

The simple certainty in that one word nearly breaks me.

"I see you," Claire continues quietly. "I see someone who's scared and angry and trying so hard to be better than the life he was given. I see someone who's fighting every single day to become something different. I see someone who cares so much he's terrified of letting people down."

She reaches out slowly, carefully, like I'm a spooked horse. Her hand settles on my arm.

I flinch, but I don't pull away.

"I'm not scared of you," she says again. "I'm scared for you. Because I know how hard you're trying, and I saw how much it hurt you to lose control. I saw your face after the fight, Rick. You were devastated. You hated what you'd done. That's not your father. That's you being someone better than him."

My throat is tight. I can't speak.

"You're not him," Claire says one more time. "I know you're not. The question is, when are you going to believe it?"

I look at her hand on my arm. Look at her face, calm and certain and completely unafraid.

She's not giving up on me.

Even after everything she saw yesterday, everything I proved about what a Dalton really is, she's standing here in this barn telling me I'm not my father.

Believing in me when I don't believe in myself.

"I don't know how to be what you think I can be," I admit quietly.

"Yes you do," Claire says. "You've been doing it all summer. You just have to keep doing it. Even when you fail. Even when you mess up. You get up the next day and try again."

"That sounds exhausting."

"It is." She almost smiles. "But you're not doing it alone."

The words hit me square in the chest. The implication behind them—that she's in this with me, that she's not walking away, that somehow after everything I'm still not alone—it's almost too much to process.

"Why?" I ask. "Why would you still want anything to do with me after yesterday?"

Claire is quiet for a moment. Then she says, "Because the day you punched that fence post and I asked you what you were really angry about? You answered. You let me see past all the rage to what was really underneath. You let me see you."

She squeezes my arm gently.

"And what I saw was someone worth fighting for," she finishes. "Someone worth believing in. Yesterday didn't change that, Rick. It just proved that you've got more work to do. But I already knew that. We both did."

I stand there in the dim barn with Claire's hand on my arm and her words settling into my chest like stones.

She's not giving up on me.

She's not scared.

She still believes I can be better.

And maybe—just maybe—that's enough to make me believe it too.
