# Chapter 1: Nothing But Speed

The only time I feel like I can breathe is when I'm doing ninety with my foot on the floor.

My hands grip the steering wheel of my '55 Chevy, and the back roads outside Pine Valley stretch out in front of me like a promise. It's Friday night, just past ten, and Bobby Walsh is riding shotgun with that stupid grin on his face that means he's already thinking about the twenty bucks he'll win when I beat Tommy Briggs. The engine rumbles underneath us—every bolt and gasket something I put together myself with my own two hands.

"You're gonna smoke him, Rick," Bobby says, leaning out the window to yell at Tommy's Ford idling next to us at the makeshift starting line. "That heap can't touch the Chevy!"

I don't answer. I'm already somewhere else—just me and the machine and the road. No drunk father passed out at home. No teachers looking at me like I'm one bad day from jail. No whispers about Frank Dalton's kid, that hothead who's gonna end up just like his old man.

Out here, none of that matters.

Tommy Briggs revs his engine, and I can hear it's running rough. Needs a valve adjustment, maybe new rings. He's got money—his dad owns the hardware store—but he doesn't know engines like I do. Money can buy you parts, but it can't buy you the two years I spent in my garage learning every inch of this car from library books and pure determination.

"You scared, Dalton?" Tommy calls across. His buddy Hank is in the passenger seat, already laughing like they've won.

I just look at him. Don't smile, don't rise to it. I learned a long time ago that the less you say, the more people think you're dangerous. And maybe they're right.

Bobby's practically bouncing in his seat. "He ain't scared of nothing. You're about to lose your money and your bragging rights, Briggs."

The guy acting as starter—some kid I don't know, probably somebody's younger brother looking to feel important—steps between our cars with a bandana. The rules are simple: first one to the Henderson farm fence and back wins. Three miles out, three miles back. Straight road, two curves. Easy money.

I roll my shoulders, feel the tension sitting there like always. It's been building since I found my father on that stained couch with empty bottles around him like a shrine to failure. Didn't even wake up when I came in. Just kept snoring, smelling like whiskey and broken promises.

The rage sits in my chest, hot and familiar. Out here, I can burn it away.

The kid raises the bandana. My foot hovers over the gas, every muscle in my body coiled and ready. The Chevy's engine growls, all that power just waiting for me to unleash it. This is control. This is the only place I ever feel like I'm in charge of something, like I'm not just waiting for the next disaster to prove everyone right about me.

The bandana drops.

I slam the gas and the Chevy launches forward, tires screaming. Bobby whoops, bracing against the door as we rocket down the road. Tommy's beside us for maybe five seconds before I pull ahead. The speedometer climbs—sixty, seventy, eighty. The engine sings, perfect and powerful and mine.

"That's it!" Bobby yells over the wind. "He's done!"

I glance in the rearview. Tommy's headlights falling back. The road ahead is dark except for my beams cutting through June night. For these few perfect moments, I'm not thinking about anything but driving.

The first curve comes up—a gentle bend I've taken a hundred times. I ease off the gas and feel the Chevy drift through like we're dancing. Perfect.

The straightaway opens and I punch it. Ninety-five. Fence posts blur into a continuous line. Bobby's laughing, high on speed and victory. Tommy's gone from my mirror.

The second curve is sharper. I know this road, know exactly where to brake. But tonight something's different. The anger burning in my gut. My hands gripping the wheel so tight my knuckles are white. Maybe I just want to feel more in control than I actually am.

I come in too hot.

The realization hits the same moment I tap the brakes. Too fast. The Chevy's rear end starts to slide, and I can feel that precise second where physics stops being my friend. I've got maybe two heartbeats to correct it.

I yank the wheel left, trying to pull out of the slide.

Overcorrection.

The Chevy fishtails right, and now I'm fighting it—wheel spinning in my hands, Bobby yelling something I can't hear over the screaming tires and my own heartbeat thundering in my ears. The world tilts and spins. Headlights catch the Henderson farm fence, that white painted wood I've passed a thousand times, and I'm heading straight for it.

I stomp the brake, but it's too late. Momentum doesn't care about regret.

The Chevy hits the fence at forty miles per hour.

Wood explodes around us with a sound like the world breaking. The fence posts snap and splinter, rails turning into projectiles. We're airborne for a second—one impossible second where everything's suspended and quiet—and then we slam down into earth that should be solid but gives way underneath us.

The garden.

We plow through rows of something—vegetables, I don't know, can't tell—dirt and plants spraying up over the hood. The Chevy finally stops, engine still running, settled at an angle in the destroyed earth. Steam hisses from somewhere under the hood. My headlights point at the Henderson farmhouse, dark and quiet in the distance.

For a long moment, neither of us moves.

"Rick?" Bobby's voice is shaky. "You okay?"

I can't answer right away. My hands are still locked on the steering wheel, every muscle in my body rigid. My heart's pounding so hard it hurts. The engine idles underneath us, that sound that usually means peace but right now just sounds like guilt.

"Yeah," I finally say. My voice comes out rough. "You?"

"Yeah. Yeah, I'm good." Bobby looks around at the destruction. "Oh man. Oh man, Rick, we're in trouble."

I know. I already know.

I force myself to let go of the wheel. My hands are shaking—from adrenaline, from fear, from the crash. I push the door open and climb out onto ground that's soft with torn-up plants and churned earth. The night air hits my face, warm and heavy with the smell of summer and gasoline and broken wood.

The fence is destroyed. At least thirty feet of it, just gone. White painted rails scattered like broken bones, fence posts snapped at the base. And the garden—what I drove through—is completely ruined. Tire tracks cut through neat rows, plants crushed and uprooted.

Behind us, I hear Tommy's Ford approaching, then stopping. Voices, excited and scared.

"Holy hell, Dalton!"

"Is he dead?"

"Somebody's gonna call the cops."

Bobby's standing next to me now, and I can feel him waiting for me to say something, to do something. But I'm just staring at the damage I caused. All that control I thought I had, all that power I felt—it was an illusion. I'm the same screwup everyone thinks I am.

The Dalton kid. Born to destroy things.

"We should go," Bobby says quietly. "Rick, we gotta go before Henderson comes out or somebody calls Sheriff Webb."

He's right. I should get back in the Chevy, back out of this mess, run like I always run. But I can't make myself move. I just stand there in the darkness, surrounded by destruction, and feel the rage draining out of me into something worse.

Fear.

Real, cold fear about what happens when the sun comes up and Tom Henderson sees what I did to his property. About what Sheriff Webb will say when he shows up. About how this is exactly the kind of thing that proves I'm my father's son—reckless, destructive, hopeless.

"Rick." Bobby's hand on my shoulder. "Come on, man."

The Chevy's still running, somehow. I can hear the engine ticking over, faithful and true. I built that car from nothing. Spent two years of my life making it something beautiful. And tonight I used it to destroy somebody else's hard work.

"Let's go," I say finally.

We climb back in. The Chevy backs out of the ruined garden with a sickening crunch of broken plants under the tires. I don't look at the damage. Can't. Just get the car back onto the road, where Tommy and his friends scatter out of the way.

Nobody says anything as I drive past them. Tommy's smart enough to know this isn't the time for jokes.

Bobby's quiet the whole drive back to town. When I drop him at his house, he just says, "It'll be okay, Rick. They might not even figure out it was you."

But we both know that's a lie. In a town like Pine Valley, everybody knows everything. By tomorrow morning, the whole town will know what Rick Dalton did. Add it to the list of reasons to avoid the kid from the wrong side of town, the one with the drunk for a father and a temper hot enough to burn.

I drive to my house—if you can call it that. Run-down rental on Maple Street with peeling paint and a porch with broken steps my father keeps meaning to fix. The Chevy's damaged but drivable. Dented front end, one headlight cracked, probably some undercarriage damage I'll have to assess in daylight.

Inside, my father's exactly where I left him. Hasn't moved. Doesn't even know I was in a crash. Doesn't know anything about my life and wouldn't care if he did.

I walk past him to my room, close the door, and sit on my bed in the darkness.

My hands are still shaking.

Tomorrow, I'll have to face what I did. Tomorrow, consequences will come crashing down like that fence I went through. Tomorrow, Sheriff Webb and Tom Henderson and the whole town of Pine Valley will have one more reason to look at me and see exactly what they've always seen.

A hothead. A screwup. Frank Dalton's son.

Tonight, all I can do is sit here in the dark and know that the only time I ever feel in control is a lie.

And maybe I've been lying to myself about a lot more than just that.
