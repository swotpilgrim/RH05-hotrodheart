# Chapter 17: Progress and Fear

The next two weeks are the best of my life and the scariest, which is a combination that keeps me awake at night trying to figure out if I'm coming or going.

Every morning I show up at the Henderson farm before dawn, and Claire's already there with the sun just starting to paint the sky pink. We work side by side—sometimes on the vegetable garden, sometimes mending the endless fence lines, sometimes just maintaining the hundred small things that keep a working farm running. We talk more now. Not about anything earth-shattering, just the easy back-and-forth of two people who've learned each other's rhythms. She tells me about the book she's reading on crop rotation. I tell her about the modification I'm planning for the Chevy's carburetor. She asks questions that show she's actually listening. I find myself listening back.

And when the anger comes—because it still comes, burning up from my gut like it always has—I stop. I breathe. I count to ten like Claire taught me that day she found me with bleeding knuckles after I'd punched the fence post.

It's working.

Not perfectly. Not like some miracle cure where Rick Dalton wakes up one morning as a different person. But working enough that I can feel the difference. When Bobby made a crack last week about me "going soft," I felt the familiar rage spike. My hands clenched into fists. My jaw locked. But instead of swinging, instead of shoving him against the nearest wall and proving I'm exactly the hothead everyone knows I am, I stopped. Counted to ten. Breathed through it until the red edges of my vision cleared.

Then I told Bobby to go to hell and walked away.

Not perfect. But better.

Tom Henderson's noticed. He doesn't say much—he's not the kind of man who deals in a lot of words—but last Tuesday when we were hauling hay, he mentioned that I'm a good worker. That I've exceeded his expectations.

"Wasn't sure what I was getting when I made you that deal," he said, wiping sweat from his forehead. "Figured I'd give you a chance to prove you could do honest work, but I half expected you'd blow up or quit before the summer was out."

I didn't know what to say to that, so I just nodded.

"You've surprised me, Rick. In a good way."

The words settled in my chest warm and heavy. I'm not used to adults saying things like that to me. Most adults in Pine Valley look at me like I'm a problem waiting to happen.

The work helps. Waking up sore from actual labor instead of from sleeping on the couch because my old man's passed out in my bed. Eating regular meals—Claire's mother keeps sending lunch, and I'm pretty sure she's packing extra because she knows I don't eat much at home. Falling into bed exhausted at night and actually sleeping instead of lying awake listening to my father stumble around drunk.

I'm sleeping better than I have in years. Eight hours straight most nights. No dreams. Just deep, dark nothing until the alarm goes off at five and I drag myself up to do it all over again.

My old man's noticed too, though his reaction is different from Tom Henderson's.

"Look at you," he said last week when I came home with dirt under my fingernails and hay in my hair. He was sitting in his usual spot on the couch, whiskey bottle on the floor beside him. "Working like some kind of farmer. Think you're better than the rest of us now?"

I didn't answer. Just went to my room and shut the door.

"That's right, walk away," he called after me. "Just like your mother. Too good for your own family."

I counted to ten. Breathed. Didn't put my fist through the wall like I wanted to.

Progress.

But if my father and Tom Henderson have noticed the changes in me, other people have too. And that's where the fear comes in.

Bobby's been distant. We've been best friends since grade school—been through everything together, from our first fistfight in sixth grade to building our cars from scrap metal. But lately when I see him at Murphy's Diner or around town, there's this distance between us that wasn't there before.

Last Saturday he asked if I wanted to work on his transmission with him. I said I couldn't, that I had to be at the farm early the next morning. He just looked at me like he didn't recognize me.

"You know the summer's almost over, right?" he said. "You've done your time. Henderson got his fence fixed. You don't have to keep playing farmboy."

"It's not playing," I said.

"Sure looks like it from here."

We haven't talked much since then.

And then there's the town.

Pine Valley is small enough that everyone knows everyone's business, and apparently Rick Dalton spending his entire summer at the Henderson farm is very interesting business.

Jenny Morrison works at her parents' diner, and she's friends with Claire. Last week Claire and I went into town to pick up supplies at the hardware store—just normal farm errand stuff—and Jenny saw us. I could see it in her face, the way her eyes widened, the way she watched Claire laugh at something I said about the fence posts.

By the next day, half the town was talking.

"Heard the Dalton boy's been working up at the Henderson place all summer," I overheard someone say at the garage where I work part-time.

"Tom Henderson always did believe in lost causes," someone else answered.

Lost causes. That's what I am to them. The Dalton kid who's going to end up just like his drunk father no matter how many fences he fixes.

Sheriff Webb stopped me outside Miller's Drug Store on Thursday. Didn't say anything, just gave me that look—the one that says he's waiting for me to screw up so he can prove he was right about me all along.

I can feel the whole town watching. Waiting.

And the worst part is, I know exactly what they're waiting for. They're waiting for me to blow up. To lose my temper. To prove that I'm exactly what they've always thought I was—nothing but trouble with a bad name and a worse future.

They're waiting for me to fail.

I've never cared before. Never gave a damn what Pine Valley thought of Rick Dalton. They already made up their minds about me years ago, so why bother trying to change their opinions?

But now I care.

Now I lie awake at night thinking about how Tom Henderson said I exceeded his expectations, and how Claire looks at me like I'm someone worth knowing, and how for the first time in my life I'm building something instead of just breaking things.

And I'm terrified I'm going to lose it.

That's the new fear. Not the fear of being trapped in Pine Valley forever, or of ending up like my father, or of dying in some stupid street race because I pushed the Chevy too hard. Those fears are still there, but they're background noise now.

The real fear—the one that wakes me up at three in the morning with my heart pounding—is the fear of having something good and losing it.

I've never had anything to lose before. Never had anything worth protecting. My car, sure, but that's just metal and engineering. I built it once, I could build another one.

This is different.

Claire is different.

The way she makes me want to count to ten instead of throwing punches. The way she hums while she works and doesn't get rattled when I'm in a mood. The way she believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. The way she looks at me sometimes, like she's seeing someone I didn't know I could be.

I can't lose that.

But I don't know how to keep it either.

Every day I show up at that farm, I'm walking a tightrope. One wrong move, one moment where I let the anger take over instead of breathing through it, one time where I prove everyone right about what a Dalton really is, and it's over.

Tom Henderson will realize he made a mistake trusting me. Claire will see that I'm exactly what everyone said I was. The town will nod and say they knew all along.

And I'll go back to being the angry kid with nothing to lose.

Except now I'll know what I lost. I'll spend the rest of my life knowing that I had something real and good and I destroyed it because I couldn't keep my temper in check.

That fear is worse than any anger I've ever felt.

So I count to ten. I breathe. I show up every morning before dawn and work until dusk, and I try like hell to be the person Claire thinks I can be.

And I pray it's enough.

Because for the first time in my life, I have something to lose.

And that scares me more than anything.
