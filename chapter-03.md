# Chapter 3: A Summer Sentence

"Come inside," Henderson says, turning toward the farmhouse. "We'll talk details."

I follow him across the yard, hyperaware of Claire walking beside her father. She still hasn't said a word to me. Just exists in this calm, steady silence that makes me more nervous than if she'd been yelling.

The farmhouse is exactly what I expected—clean, organized, the kind of place where a family actually lives instead of just survives. We go through the back door into the kitchen.

Everything's neat. Counters wiped down, dishes put away, checkered curtains on the windows. A table with four chairs, all of them steady on their legs. Family photos on the walls. The whole room smells like coffee and something baked recently.

It's the kind of kitchen my mother probably wanted before she left.

"Have a seat," Henderson says.

I sit, feeling out of place. My jeans have grease stains, boots probably tracked in dirt.

Claire leans against the doorframe, arms crossed, watching. Henderson pours himself coffee from a pot on the stove, then sits across from me. He doesn't offer me any. This isn't a social visit.

"Let's be clear about what you're agreeing to," Henderson says. "This isn't a favor. This is you working off a debt."

"Yes, sir. I understand that."

"The damage is worth at least two hundred dollars in materials and labor. The fence alone—thirty feet of white oak rails, treated posts, paint. Plus the garden my daughter planted. Seeds, starter plants, six weeks of her time."

I glance at Claire. Still watching with that unreadable expression.

"I'll work off every cent," I say. "However long it takes."

"It'll take all summer," Henderson says flatly. "Six days a week, dawn to dusk. Monday through Saturday, six in the morning to six or seven at night, depending on the work."

Twelve hours a day. Six days a week. For the entire summer.

"What about my job at Murphy's garage?"

Henderson's eyebrows raise. "You'll have to figure that out. This is six days a week. If Murphy needs you, you'll have to tell him no. You've got Sundays off—that's it."

My stomach sinks. Murphy's been good to me. If I tell him I can't work all summer, he might replace me. I need that job.

But I also need to stay out of jail.

"Okay," I say. "Six days a week. I'll make it work."

Henderson nods. "The work won't be easy. We've got fence lines that need mending all over the property. Irrigation ditches to clear, barn repairs, whatever else needs doing. You'll be working with your hands in the sun. Have you done farm work before?"

"No, sir."

"Then you're going to be sore. Real sore, especially the first couple weeks."

I think about hours spent bent over engines, pulling transmissions. But Henderson's probably right—this will be different.

"I can handle it," I say.

"We'll see." Henderson sets his mug down. "Here's what I expect: show up on time every morning. Six AM sharp. Work hard—actually work, not stand around. Do what you're told without argument. Treat my property and my family with respect. And most importantly—" He leans forward. "You show up sober."

There it is again.

My jaw tightens. "I don't drink, Mr. Henderson."

"I'm not saying you do. But your father—"

"I'm not my father."

The words come out sharper than intended. Henderson's eyes narrow, and I force myself to breathe, unclench my fists under the table.

"I know Frank Dalton's reputation," Henderson says carefully. "I'm not judging you. But I need to know that when you show up here, you'll be clearheaded and ready to work. Can you promise me that?"

The shame burns hot. Everyone knows what my father is. They all assume the son's the same.

"I can promise you that," I say, voice steady. "I don't drink. Never touched the stuff. And I show up when I say I will."

Henderson studies me, then nods slowly. "All right. I'll take you at your word. But if you break that promise even once, the deal's off and Sheriff Webb gets called. Understood?"

"Yes, sir."

"Good." Henderson picks up his coffee. "Now, about supervision. I can't be with you every minute—I've got my own work. So my daughter Claire will be overseeing what you do."

I look at Claire. She straightens slightly.

"It's her garden you destroyed," Henderson continues. "Seems fair she's the one who decides when you've made it right. She'll tell you what needs doing each day, make sure you're doing it correctly."

Great.

"She knows this farm as well as I do," Henderson says. "Probably better. She's been working it since she was old enough to carry a bucket. If she tells you to do something, you do it. If she says you're doing it wrong, you fix it. Understood?"

"Understood," I manage.

I force myself to meet Claire's eyes. She's looking right at me now. Evaluating me. Trying to figure out if I'm worth the trouble.

I wish I knew.

"Do you have any questions?" Henderson asks.

About a hundred. But most don't have answers I want to hear.

"What if the work takes longer than summer? What if I don't finish?"

"Then you keep working until it's done," Henderson says simply. "But if you show up every day and put in honest work, you'll finish. Three months of labor. That's plenty of time."

"And if I finish early?"

Henderson's mouth twitches. "You won't. Trust me."

Fair enough.

"Anything else?"

I don't want him to think I'm looking for excuses.

"No, sir," I say. "I'll be here Monday morning at six."

"See that you are." Henderson stands, and I stand too. "Claire, show him where the tool shed is. That way he knows where to go Monday."

Claire nods and pushes off the doorframe. "Follow me," she says.

It's the first thing she's said directly to me. Her voice is quiet, matter-of-fact. No anger, no judgment. Just nothing.

I follow her back out into the yard. The sun's higher now, warming the June morning. Claire walks with easy confidence toward a shed near the barn.

"Tools are in here," she says, opening the shed door. Inside it's organized—tools on pegboards, supplies stacked on shelves, everything labeled. "Hammers, saws, posthole diggers, wire cutters. If you need something specific, ask first. Don't just take it."

"Okay."

She points to a section near the barn. "That's where we keep lumber and fencing supplies. Treated posts, rails, whatever you need. Ask before you use something so we know what's being used."

"Got it."

Claire closes the shed door and turns to look at me. Really look at me, for the first time. Up close, I can see her eyes are gray-blue, calm and direct. She's taller than I thought—maybe five-six. Strong, too. You can see it in her shoulders. This is someone who works, really works.

"Monday morning," she says. "Six AM. We'll start with clearing the broken fence debris and pulling out the damaged posts. Wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty and boots with good tread. It's going to be hard work."

"I'm not afraid of hard work."

"Good." She pauses. "And my father's right about the drinking thing. If you show up hungover or drunk, I'll tell him immediately. This is my farm, too. I'm not going to let you put anyone at risk."

The assumption stings, but I keep my voice level. "I said I don't drink. I meant it."

"We'll see."

She doesn't say it meanly. Just states it like a fact, reserving judgment. I guess I can't blame her. Actions matter more than words, especially when your last name is Dalton.

"Anything else?"

"Yeah." Claire crosses her arms. "That garden you destroyed? I started it in March. Cold frames for the early starts, direct sowing when the frost passed, transplanting the seedlings I grew from seed. Tomatoes, peppers, beans, squash, lettuce, carrots, onions. Six weeks of work before you drove through it. I'm not telling you this to make you feel bad—I'm telling you so you understand what you're rebuilding."

The weight of it settles on my shoulders. Six weeks. Hours of her time, her effort. And I destroyed it in three seconds.

"I'm sorry," I say again. Still sounds inadequate.

"I know." She uncrosses her arms. "Monday morning. Don't be late."

"I won't."

Claire nods once, then turns and walks back toward the farmhouse, leaving me standing alone.

I head back to my Chevy, mind spinning. Twelve-hour days, six days a week, all summer. Under supervision of a girl who has every reason to hate me, working off a debt I earned through stupidity.

As I drive down the driveway, I glance in the rearview. The Henderson farm sits there in morning sunlight, neat and solid. In two days, that's going to be my entire world.

I better tell Murphy I can't work this summer.

And I better figure out how to survive the next three months working for people who assume the worst about me—because right now, I'm not sure I can prove them wrong.

But I'm going to try.

I have to.
