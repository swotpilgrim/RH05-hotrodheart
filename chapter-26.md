# Chapter 26: The Demolition Derby

The posters go up all over town on Monday: Pine Valley County Fair, last week of August. The usual stuff—carnival rides, livestock shows, pie competitions. And headlining Saturday night: the demolition derby.

I see Bobby standing in front of one of the posters outside Murphy's Diner on Wednesday afternoon. I'm in town picking up supplies for Henderson, and Bobby flags me down before I can avoid him.

"You see this?" he asks, grinning. "Derby's Saturday night."

"Yeah, I see it."

"I'm entering the Ford." He's practically bouncing with excitement. "Reinforced the frame last weekend, stripped out everything that could catch fire. She's ready to get wrecked."

I nod, not sure what he wants me to say. Bobby and I haven't been talking much since I stopped racing. Since I started spending all my time at the Henderson farm. Since I became someone he doesn't quite recognize anymore.

"You should enter the Chevy," Bobby says.

I blink. "What?"

"The demolition derby. Enter the Chevy. Go out with a bang." He punches my shoulder. "Come on, man. It'd be like old times. You and me, engines roaring, destroying some stuff. Remember fun?"

I do remember fun. Remember the rush of racing on the back roads, the freedom of speed, the simplicity of just me and the engine and nothing else mattering.

But that feels like a lifetime ago.

"I don't think so," I say.

"Why not? Summer's almost over. You've done your time at the farm. Don't you want to cut loose one more time before school starts?"

"It's not about cutting loose—"

"Then what is it about?" Bobby asks, and there's an edge to his voice now. "Because from where I'm standing, you've spent the whole summer playing farmer and pretending to be someone you're not. Maybe it's time to remember who you really are."

The words sting more than they should.

"I know who I am," I say.

"Yeah? The Rick Dalton I know wouldn't spend his summer fixing fences for some rich farmer. He'd tell them to go to hell and take his chances with Sheriff Webb."

"Maybe I'm not the Rick Dalton you know anymore."

Bobby studies me for a long moment. "Maybe not. And maybe that's a shame."

He walks away, leaving me standing on the sidewalk with Henderson's supply list in my hand and a hollow feeling in my chest.

I try to forget about the conversation. Try to focus on work, on Claire, on getting through the last week and a half of summer without screwing anything else up.

But the idea sticks with me like a splinter under my skin.

The demolition derby. My Chevy. One last blaze of glory before everything changes.

I find myself thinking about it while I'm working. While I'm lying in bed at night staring at the ceiling. While I'm driving to and from the Henderson farm with my hands on the wheel of the car I built from nothing. The car that's been my one constant for two years. The car that represents everything I've ever been proud of.

The car I'm suddenly thinking about destroying.

The Chevy represents everything about my old life. The racing, the anger, the recklessness. The Rick Dalton who solved everything with speed and violence.

Maybe destroying it would be symbolic. A way of showing I'm done with all that. That I'm choosing to be someone different.

Or maybe it's just one final act of self-destruction because part of me still believes I'm going to end up like my father anyway, so why bother trying?

I can't tell which it is.

By Friday afternoon, the idea has grown from a whisper to a shout in my head. I'm at the fairgrounds picking up feed for Henderson when I see the derby registration table.

I should walk past it. Should get the feed and go back to the farm and forget this whole stupid idea.

But my feet carry me over to the table.

The woman running registration looks up. "Help you?"

"I want to enter the demolition derby," I hear myself say.

"Name?"

"Rick Dalton."

She writes it down, doesn't even blink. If she knows the Dalton name, if she knows who I am or what I did or why I shouldn't be making impulsive decisions about destroying my car, she doesn't show it.

"Vehicle?"

"'55 Chevy."

"Entry fee is five dollars."

I pull the money from my pocket—money I earned working at the garage, not Henderson's money. This is mine. My choice. My car. My self-destruction.

She takes the money, hands me a registration slip.

"Gates open at six Saturday. Derby starts at seven. Don't be late."

I take the slip and walk back to my truck with the feed, my heart pounding.

I just entered the demolition derby.

I just signed up to destroy the car I spent two years building from scrap metal.

I should feel something. Regret, maybe. Second thoughts. Anything.

But I just feel numb.

Bobby finds me loading the feed and sees the registration slip sticking out of my pocket.

"No way," he says, breaking into a huge grin. "You actually entered?"

"Yeah."

"Yes! This is going to be great. Just like old times, man. You and me tearing it up. Everyone's going to be there. The whole town. They're going to lose their minds when they see Rick Dalton's back."

Back. Like I ever left. Like spending the summer learning to be better means I disappeared.

"Bobby—"

"We should practice. Make sure the cars can handle it. I've got my safety gear, you'll need to get—"

"I've got it handled," I interrupt.

He's so excited that I don't have the heart to tell him this isn't about old times. Isn't about fun or friendship or cutting loose. Isn't about being back.

I don't even know what it's about anymore.

But Bobby's grinning like we're fifteen again and nothing's changed, and I just nod and let him talk about strategy and technique and which cars to watch out for.

Like any of it matters.

That evening, after I'm done at the Henderson farm, after Claire has gone inside for dinner and Henderson has told me good work and I've driven home to my empty house, I go out to the garage where I keep the Chevy.

The car sits there in the dim light, cherry red paint gleaming even though it's dusty. I built this car. Spent two years learning engines from library books, buying parts with money from odd jobs, bleeding and sweating and cursing my way through every mistake until I figured it out.

I rebuilt it from nothing.

Made something beautiful out of scrap metal and determination.

And tomorrow night I'm going to drive it into an arena and let other cars smash it to pieces.

I pop the hood and check the engine. Everything's in good shape—I maintain it religiously. The oil's fresh, the belts are tight, the carburetor's clean.

It's a good engine. A good car.

I should be proud of it.

I am proud of it.

So why am I about to destroy it?

I close the hood and lean against the fender, trying to sort through the mess in my head.

Maybe it's symbolic. Maybe destroying the car that represents the old Rick Dalton will somehow make it official that I'm someone different now. That I've changed.

Or maybe I'm scared that I haven't really changed at all. That I'm still the same angry kid who solves everything with violence and speed. That the summer at the Henderson farm was just pretending, and sooner or later I'll revert to who I really am.

Maybe destroying the Chevy is a way of proving I'm done with that old life.

Or maybe it's just giving up.

I don't know anymore.

I run my hand along the fender, feeling the smooth paint, the solid metal underneath. I built this. Took something broken and made it whole.

Claire's words from Saturday come back to me: *You rebuilt a car from scrap metal. You can rebuild yourself too.*

But what if I don't want to rebuild? What if I want to start completely over? Wipe the slate clean and see what's left?

What if I'm just tired of carrying around this thing that represents who I used to be?

I don't have answers.

All I know is that tomorrow night at seven, I'll be in the demolition derby arena with engines roaring and metal crunching and the whole town watching.

And I'll either prove I'm someone different.

Or I'll prove Bobby was right, and I'm exactly who I've always been.

I leave the garage and go inside. My father's passed out on the couch as usual. I step over him and go to my room.

Tomorrow's Friday. One more day of work at the Henderson farm. One more day with Claire. One more day of pretending I know what I'm doing.

Then Saturday. The fair. The derby.

The end.

I lie in bed and stare at the ceiling, and I can't shake the feeling that I'm about to make a huge mistake.

But I don't know how to stop it.

Don't know how to walk away from the decision I've already made.

So I'll show up. I'll strap in. I'll let the destruction happen.

And maybe afterward I'll know if I'm really someone different.

Or if I'm still just Frank Dalton's son, destroying everything good I manage to build.
