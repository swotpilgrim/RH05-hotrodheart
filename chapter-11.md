# Chapter 11: Claire's Truth

I pull up to the Henderson farm Thursday morning half expecting things to be weird.

Yesterday I punched a fence post, confessed my deepest fears about becoming my father, and had dinner with Claire's family. Today should be awkward, right? That's how it works when you show someone the broken parts—they get uncomfortable, start treating you differently.

But when I walk up to the tool shed, Claire just looks at my bandaged hand and says, "My mother left fresh bandages in the barn. Change them at lunch."

That's it. No careful tiptoeing. Just practical instruction and moving on.

I grab my tools and we head to the fence line. Same work. Same routine. Like yesterday was just another day.

And somehow, that makes it better.

We work in comfortable silence for the first hour. My hand throbs when I grip the shovel, but the bandage helps. Claire glances at it occasionally but doesn't comment.

The morning is hot, promising another scorcher by noon. We're replacing more rotted posts—steady work that doesn't require much talking.

Around ten o'clock, Claire sets down her shovel and takes a long drink.

"Can I ask you something?" she says.

"Yeah."

"What are you going to do after graduation? Next June."

The question catches me off guard. "I don't know. Haven't thought about it much."

"You must have some idea."

I lean on my shovel. "I figured I'd get a job somewhere. Maybe work at Henderson's garage full-time. Save up money. Eventually leave Pine Valley."

"Where would you go?"

"Anywhere that's not here." The answer comes automatically. "Somewhere nobody knows I'm Frank Dalton's kid. Somewhere I can just be me."

Claire nods like this makes sense. Then she says, "Everyone in this town has my life already mapped out for me."

I look at her, surprised by the sudden shift.

"Marry a local boy," she continues. "Preferably someone with farmland. Have kids. Help run this farm until my father retires. Then hand it over to my husband while I focus on raising children."

The bitterness in her tone is unmistakable.

"That's the plan everyone assumes," Claire says. "My parents. The church ladies. Teachers. Even the boys who ask me to dances—they're not interested in me, they're interested in Tom Henderson's land and the girl who comes with it."

She picks up a rock and throws it hard toward the tree line.

"And nobody has ever asked me what I want."

I don't know what to say, so I wait.

Claire takes another drink, then looks at me. "I applied to Michigan State last spring. Agricultural program. Modern farming techniques, soil science, irrigation systems, crop management. Everything I'd need to run a really successful operation."

"That's good, right? That's what you want."

"I got in. Full scholarship."

I stare at her. "That's amazing, Claire."

"My father said no."

The words drop like stones.

"What do you mean, he said no?"

"I told him about the acceptance letter, the scholarship, the program. Showed him everything." Claire's jaw is tight. "And he said no. Said girls don't need college. That I know enough already, and anything else I need to know, my future husband can teach me."

"That's—" I stop, not sure what word fits.

"Infuriating?" Claire supplies. "Yeah."

She goes back to digging, stabbing the shovel harder than necessary.

"The worst part is that he thinks he's being reasonable. Thinks he's protecting me from wasting time on education I don't need. He actually said, 'Claire, you're a smart girl, but your place is here on the farm, helping your family until you have your own family to care for.'"

"What did you say?"

"Nothing. What could I say? He's my father. This is his farm. I'm sixteen. I don't get a vote."

I watch her work, seeing her completely differently now.

All summer I've been thinking Claire Henderson has it made. Nice family, successful farm, everyone in town respecting the Hendersons.

But I was wrong. She's just as trapped as I am. Different cage, same feeling.

"You could go anyway," I say. "When you're eighteen. He couldn't stop you then."

"No, but he could refuse to help. The scholarship covers tuition, but not room and board. Not books or supplies. I'd need at least some support."

"You could get a job. Work while you study."

"Maybe. If I could save up enough first." She wipes sweat from her forehead. "But it's not just about the money, Rick. It's about him not even considering it. Not even asking what I want or why it matters. Just deciding that his view of my life is the only view that counts."

Her voice cracks slightly on the last words, and I realize this is the first time I've seen Claire anything less than completely controlled.

"I'm sorry," I say, and I mean it.

"For what? You didn't tell me girls don't need college."

"No, but I'm sorry you're stuck. I know what that feels like."

Claire looks at me, and something passes between us. Recognition. Understanding.

"You do, don't you?" she says quietly.

"Yeah. Different reasons, but yeah. The feeling that everyone's already decided who you are and what you'll become."

"Exactly." Claire sets down her shovel and sits on a nearby fence post, looking exhausted. "Everyone sees me as Tom Henderson's daughter. The girl who'll marry well and have babies and be a good farm wife. Nobody asks if I want to innovate agricultural practices or study soil science."

"That's what you want, though. To run this place. Just run it your way."

"I want to make it better. Use what I learn to improve yields and reduce waste." Her eyes light up when she talks about it, the same way mine do when I talk about engines. "I want to prove that a woman can run a farm just as well as a man. Better, even, with the right training."

"You could do it," I say with certainty. "If anyone could, it's you."

"Maybe. If I ever get the chance." She looks out across the fields. "Two more years until I'm eighteen. Two more years of everyone telling me what my life should be. And then what? If my father won't help, I'll have to choose between his support and my dreams."

I understand that choice. I've been making it my whole life—stay with Frank and endure his drinking, or leave and have nothing.

"For what it's worth," I say, "I think you'd be a hell of a student. And you'd run the best farm in Michigan."

Claire looks at me, and there's something vulnerable in her expression. Like my opinion actually matters.

"Thank you," she says. "That means something."

We sit in silence for a minute. Yesterday I showed Claire my broken parts. Today she's showing me hers.

"We're quite a pair," I say finally. "You trapped by expectations of what a girl should want. Me trapped by what people think a Dalton will become."

"At least we understand each other."

"Yeah. At least there's that."

Claire stands up, brushes dirt off her jeans. "We should get back to work. This fence won't fix itself."

"One more question," I say.

"What?"

"If you could go to Michigan State, would you? Even if it meant fighting with your father?"

Claire doesn't hesitate. "Yes. In a heartbeat. Because it's my life, and I should get to decide what I do with it."

"Then you should fight for it," I say. "Maybe not now. But in two years? Fight like hell. Don't let them decide for you."

"That's rich coming from someone planning to run away from Pine Valley."

"I'm not running away. I'm just leaving for somewhere I can be something other than Frank Dalton's kid."

"That's running away, Rick. Just with a better story."

She's right. But I don't know what else to do. Can't fight my father's reputation or the town's opinion of me.

Can I?

"Maybe we're both running," I say. "You toward college, me toward anywhere else."

"Or maybe we're both just trying to survive until we can choose our own lives."

Claire picks up her shovel. "Either way, we've got fence posts to replace. Come on."

We go back to work, and the rhythm is the same as before—dig, remove, replace, pack. But something's different now. We're not just supervisor and worker anymore. We're two people stuck in different cages, understanding what that feels like.

Around noon we break for lunch. Claire hands me fresh bandages, and I change them while she unpacks sandwiches. My knuckles look better—less swollen, scabs forming.

"Healing fast," Claire observes.

"Yeah. Your mother did a good job."

"She's had practice. My father's punched a few walls in his time."

I think about her father learning to channel anger differently.

"Did it scare you?" I ask. "When your father got angry like that."

Claire considers it. "Sometimes. When I was really little. But he never directed it at us. And he stopped once my mother told him it was affecting me. That's the difference."

"What is?"

"Caring enough to change for them. Your father doesn't care. Mine did." She hands me a sandwich. "You do too, or you wouldn't worry about becoming him."

It's the second time she's said that—pointing out that my fear of being like Frank means I'm different. I'm starting to think she's right.

We eat in comfortable silence, and I realize this is becoming my favorite part of the day. Not the work itself, but these breaks. These conversations. Finding out Claire Henderson isn't just the capable, controlled girl everyone sees. She's someone with her own dreams and frustrations and fights she can't win yet.

She's someone like me.

"Thank you," I say as we're cleaning up from lunch.

"For what? The sandwich?"

"For telling me. About Michigan State and your father. You didn't have to."

"You told me about yours yesterday. Seemed fair."

"Yeah, but..." I struggle to articulate it. "I've spent all summer thinking you had everything figured out. That your life was easy and perfect and I was the only one struggling."

"Everyone struggles, Rick. Some of us are just better at hiding it."

"You're good at that. The hiding part."

"Had a lot of practice." Claire slings her water jug over her shoulder. "Come on. We've got four more hours of work and six more posts to replace."

We head back to the fence line, and I'm thinking about cages and fighting and choosing your own life. About Claire with her scholarship letter and her father's refusal. About me with my Chevy and my anger and my father's prophecy that I'll end up just like him.

Neither of us is free yet.

But at least we're not alone.

And maybe that's enough to keep fighting.
