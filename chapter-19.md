# Chapter 19: The Fistfight

The first punch feels inevitable. Like gravity. Like something that was always going to happen no matter how hard I tried to stop it.

My fist connects with my father's jaw, and the impact travels up my arm, sharp and satisfying and terrible all at once. He staggers backward, blood already welling from where his teeth cut the inside of his cheek.

For a second we both just stand there, breathing hard. Him bleeding. Me with my knuckles throbbing. The Henderson farmyard absolutely silent except for Claire's sharp intake of breath.

Then my father spits blood into the dirt and grins. It's the grin of a man who just got exactly what he wanted.

"That's my boy," he says.

And he swings back.

I'm faster than him—younger, sober, fueled by months of suppressed rage instead of years of cheap whiskey. I dodge the punch easily, feel it whistle past my ear. But he's got momentum now, stumbling forward, and we crash together like cars on the back roads.

It's not a fight. Not really. Not like the controlled matches in the school gym or even the street fights I've been in where there were rules, however unspoken. This is just violence—pure and ugly and everything I've been trying not to be all summer.

My father catches me in the ribs with an elbow. The air rushes out of my lungs, and for a second I can't breathe. He uses the momentum to shove me backward, and I stumble, catch myself against the barn wall.

"Come on," he's saying, his words slurred and sharp. "Show them what you are. Show the Hendersons what they really invited onto their property."

Somewhere distant I hear Claire yelling for us to stop. Hear Tom Henderson's boots pounding across the farmyard. But it all sounds underwater, muffled by the blood pounding in my ears.

I push off the barn and go at him again.

This time my punch catches him square in the nose. I feel something crunch under my knuckles—cartilage or bone, I don't know and don't care. Blood explodes across his face, down his shirt, bright red in the August sun.

He doesn't go down though. Just shakes his head like a dog and comes at me harder.

We're both swinging now, most of the punches missing, some connecting. He catches my cheek and my head snaps to the side, white stars exploding across my vision. I taste copper, warm and metallic. I grab his shirt—some ratty t-shirt that probably hasn't been washed in a week, that smells like sweat and whiskey and everything I've been trying to escape—and use it to pull him close enough to hit him again. My fist connects with his ribs and he grunts, staggers, but doesn't go down.

We crash into something. The fence. The fence I spent six weeks fixing, measuring every board, making sure each post was level and secure. Wood splinters. A rail cracks.

The sound of it breaking—the sound of my work, my progress, my whole summer splintering under the weight of this fight—it should stop me.

It doesn't.

Because I'm not thinking anymore. All the breathing techniques Claire taught me, all the counting to ten, all the careful control I've been learning—it's gone. Burned away by rage that's been building for seventeen years.

This isn't about what my father said about Claire. Not anymore.

This is about every time he came home drunk when I was a kid and I had to pretend everything was fine. About cleaning up his messes and lying to the neighbors and watching him drink away any chance we had at being a normal family. About my mother leaving and him blaming me like I was the reason she couldn't stand to stay. About living in that run-down house and being the town joke because everybody knows Frank Dalton's a drunk and his kid's going to turn out just the same.

This is about being scared every single day that he's right. That I am exactly like him.

That no matter how hard I try, I'll end up drunk and bitter and alone, destroying everything good I ever touch.

My father's on the ground now. I don't remember pushing him down, but he's there, and I'm on top of him, and my fist is rising and falling, rising and falling.

His face is a mess of blood. My knuckles are screaming. And I can't stop.

"Rick!" Claire's voice, high and scared. "Rick, stop!"

I don't stop.

"That's enough!" Tom Henderson, closer now.

I don't stop.

Because if I stop, I have to face what I'm doing. I have to look at the blood on my hands and admit that everyone was right about me. I have to see Claire's face and know that I just proved I'm exactly the monster she should've been scared of all along.

If I stop, it's real.

So I don't stop.

Strong hands grab me from behind. Tom Henderson, pulling me off bodily. I struggle against him, still trying to get to my father, still trying to make him hurt the way I've been hurting my whole life.

"Enough!" Henderson's voice is sharp, commanding, the voice of a man used to controlling half-ton animals. He hauls me backward, holds me while I fight against his grip.

My father rolls over slowly, spits blood. His face is already swelling, one eye starting to purple. He looks up at me, and even through the blood and bruises, he's smiling.

"See?" he says, his voice thick. "Exactly like me. Angry. Violent. Worthless."

The word hits me harder than any punch.

Worthless.

Henderson's still holding me back, but I've stopped struggling. The rage is draining out of me as fast as it came, leaving nothing but cold horror in its wake.

My father staggers to his feet. He's got blood running down his face, dripping onto his shirt. One of his eyes is swollen nearly shut. He looks at Henderson, then at Claire, then back at me.

"Good luck with this one," he tells Henderson. "He's a Dalton through and through. Give him time, he'll burn your whole farm down."

He limps toward his truck, moving like an old man instead of someone who's only forty-three. The door screams when he opens it. The engine coughs and sputters before catching.

Then he's driving away, the truck leaving a cloud of dust and exhaust behind.

Henderson lets go of me, and I nearly fall. My legs are shaking. My hands are covered in blood—his, mine, I can't tell anymore. My ribs ache where he elbowed me. My face throbs where he caught me.

But the physical pain is nothing compared to the realization crashing over me.

I did exactly what he said I would do.

I lost control. I let the anger take over. I proved that all the progress I made this summer was just surface-level pretending. That underneath I'm still the same hothead I've always been.

I'm still Frank Dalton's son.

I turn to look at Claire. She's standing by the barn, her face white, her hands pressed to her mouth. She's not crying. Just standing there, perfectly still, like she's frozen. Like she's seeing me for the first time. Seeing what I really am.

She saw it all. Saw me lose control completely. Saw me beat my own father bloody in her farmyard. Saw me become exactly what everyone warned her I was.

The way she's looking at me—or not looking at me, because her eyes are unfocused, shocked—it's worse than any punch I took.

Tom Henderson is standing a few feet away, breathing hard from pulling me off my father. His expression is unreadable, but it doesn't matter. I already know what he's thinking.

That he made a mistake giving me a chance. That Sheriff Webb was right, and Rick Dalton is just another waste of space from the wrong side of town. That his daughter should stay far away from someone who can turn violent that fast.

I look down at my hands. Blood is dripping from my knuckles onto the dirt. The same dirt I've been working all summer. The same farmyard where I've been learning to be someone better.

And I just destroyed it all.

The fence I spent six weeks fixing is broken again, rails splintered, posts tilted. My father's blood is on the ground. My own blood is mixing with it.

Everything I built this summer—the control, the calm, the fragile hope that I could be something more than my father's son—it's gone.

I did this.

I turned the Henderson farm into a battleground. I brought my father's violence here, to this place that gave me peace. I proved every single person who ever judged me by my last name right.

The worst part?

I can still feel the rage simmering under my skin. Still want to get in my Chevy and chase my father down and finish what we started. Still want to hit something, break something, destroy everything because destruction is what Daltons do.

We don't build. We don't heal. We don't get better.

We just destroy.

And I just destroyed the only good thing I've ever had.
