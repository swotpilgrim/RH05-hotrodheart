# Chapter 16: Midpoint—Admitting It

The tractor's been giving Tom Henderson trouble all week. Friday evening, late enough that the worst of the August heat has finally broken, we're both under the hood trying to figure out why the damn thing keeps sputtering out mid-field. My hands are black with grease, and I can feel sweat running down my back, but there's something satisfying about working on an engine—even a tractor engine—that makes the discomfort worth it.

"Try it now," Henderson calls from the driver's seat.

I tighten the connection on the fuel line and step back. He turns the key. The engine coughs, sputters, then roars to life clean and strong. We both grin like idiots.

"That's got it," Henderson says, climbing down. He claps me on the shoulder—a gesture that would've made me flinch two months ago but now just feels normal. "You've got a good hand with engines, Rick."

"Thanks, sir."

He wipes his hands on a rag and looks toward the farmhouse where the sun's starting to paint everything gold. "I'm heading in for supper. You did good work today. All summer, really."

The words settle somewhere in my chest, warm and unfamiliar. "I appreciate that."

Henderson nods and walks toward the house, leaving me alone with the rumbling tractor and the sound of crickets starting up in the fields. I'm thinking about shutting everything down when I hear footsteps behind me.

Claire's carrying two glasses of iced tea, condensation already beading on the outside. She hands me one without a word, and I drink half of it in one go. The cold hits my throat like a blessing.

"Thanks," I say, wiping my mouth.

She leans against the tractor, looking out at the fields turning amber in the evening light. We've gotten comfortable with silence, Claire and me. Don't always need to fill the air with words. But there's something in the way she's standing—something that tells me she's got a question working its way to the surface.

"Bobby stopped by the hardware store today," she finally says. "Wanted to know if you're coming to the race tonight."

My jaw tightens automatically. "No."

"He seemed surprised."

"Yeah, well." I set the empty glass down on the tractor's fender. "Bobby's surprised by a lot of things lately."

Claire turns to look at me. The setting sun catches her hair, turning the edges gold, and I have to force myself not to stare. "You haven't been racing at all this summer."

It's not a question, but I answer anyway. "No."

"Why not?"

The question hangs there between us, and I know what she's really asking. Why did I stop? What changed? When did the thing that used to be the only peace I knew stop mattering?

I could lie. Could tell her I've been too tired from farm work, or that I'm being careful not to wreck the Chevy again, or that I'm just taking a break. But I'm done lying to Claire. Been done with it for weeks now, even if I haven't been ready to admit the truth out loud.

"Racing was about control," I say slowly, choosing each word carefully. "And speed. Getting behind the wheel and just... pushing everything else out. The anger, the frustration, all the things I couldn't fix in my regular life. When I was driving, nothing else existed. Just the road and the engine and the feeling of being in control of something."

Claire nods, listening in that way she has—like she's actually hearing every word, not just waiting for her turn to talk.

"But this summer..." I trail off, looking at my grease-stained hands. "I found something better."

"What's that?"

I take a breath. This is it. The moment where I either say it or keep pretending that spending every day with Claire Henderson hasn't changed everything about who I am and what I want.

"Building things that last," I say, my voice rougher than I intend. "Working with my hands to create instead of destroy. Fixing fences instead of crashing through them. Watching things grow instead of just... burning everything down because I'm angry at the world."

The words are coming faster now, like a dam breaking. I still can't look at her.

"And being around someone who makes me want to be better. Not because she's trying to change me or fix me, but just because... when I'm near her, I don't want to be the guy everyone thinks I am. I want to be the guy she sees when she looks at me. The one who's worth something. Who could actually build a life instead of just destroying everything he touches."

The silence stretches out. A hawk calls somewhere overhead, and the tractor engine ticks as it cools. I risk a glance at Claire.

She's watching me with those steady eyes, and I can't read her expression. My heart's hammering against my ribs.

"Are you scared?" she asks softly.

The question catches me off guard. I could deny it, throw up the walls, act like Rick Dalton doesn't get scared of anything. But I'm tired of pretending. Exhausted by it.

"Terrified," I admit.

"Of what?"

"Of screwing this up." The words come out harsh, desperate. "Of proving everyone right—that I'm just the Dalton kid who ruins everything he touches. Of wanting something good and not being able to keep it. Of being so close to something real and watching it fall apart because I don't know how to be anything except angry."

I'm breathing hard now, like I've been running. My hands are curled into fists at my sides, and I have to consciously force them open.

"I've spent my whole life being told I'm worthless," I continue, and I can hear the rawness in my own voice. "That I'm going to end up just like my old man—drunk and bitter and alone. And maybe they're right. Maybe that's exactly what I am underneath all this. But I don't want to be. Not anymore. Not when..."

I stop myself before I say her name. Before I make this too real, too specific, too impossible to take back.

But Claire's not stupid. She knows exactly what I'm not saying.

"Maybe you're worth more than you think you are," she says quietly.

The words hit me harder than any punch I've ever taken. I look at her—really look at her—standing there in the golden evening light with grease on her hands from working beside me all day, her hair escaping from its braid, her face calm and certain.

She believes it. She actually believes I'm worth something.

The realization terrifies me more than anything else that's happened this summer. Because if she believes it and I let her down—if I prove her wrong—it'll destroy something in me that I didn't even know existed until I started working on this farm.

"I should go," I say, but I don't move.

Claire doesn't move either. "Okay."

But neither of us leaves. We just stand there in the fading light, the tractor cooling between us, and the weight of everything I didn't say pressing down on my chest.

I'm in love with Claire Henderson.

The thought hits me with the force of a collision, and I can't breathe for a second. I'm completely, terrifyingly in love with her, and I have absolutely no idea what to do about it.

She's a Henderson. I'm a Dalton. She's got a future ahead of her—college, dreams, a life beyond Pine Valley if she wants it. I'm the town hothead with a drunk for a father and a reputation that follows me everywhere like a shadow.

Loving her doesn't change any of that.

But standing here in the sunset, with Claire looking at me like I'm someone worth believing in, I can't make myself care about the practical reasons why this is impossible. All I can think about is that I'd work a thousand summers on this farm, fix a thousand fences, tear down and rebuild every angry wall I've ever built around myself, if it meant I could be someone worthy of the way she's looking at me right now.

"I'll see you tomorrow," Claire says finally, taking my empty glass.

"Yeah. Tomorrow."

She starts walking toward the house, and I watch her go, my heart still pounding, my hands still shaking.

I'm in too deep. Way too deep. And there's no way this ends well for me.

But as I climb into my Chevy and drive home through the gathering dusk, I realize something that scares me even more than the prospect of getting hurt: I don't want to go back to who I was before this summer. Before Claire. Before I learned that there's something better than anger and speed and the hollow victory of winning a race that doesn't matter.

I don't want to be that Rick anymore.

I want to be the Rick that Claire sees—the one who builds instead of destroys, who breathes instead of explodes, who's worth something more than his father's name and his own worst fears.

I want to be worthy of her.

And that terrifying, impossible want is the first real hope I've felt in years.
