# Chapter 4: The First Morning

Monday morning, I wake up before my alarm. Five AM, staring at the ceiling in the dark, stomach tight with something that might be nerves or just dread.

Today I start paying for what I did.

I pull on my oldest jeans and a work shirt already stained from the garage. Lace up my boots—the ones with good tread, like Claire said. In the kitchen, I grab bread and eat it standing up. My father's snoring on the couch, right where he was last night.

I don't leave a note. He wouldn't read it anyway.

The Chevy starts with a rumble that sounds too loud in pre-dawn quiet. I head toward the Henderson farm, watching the sky lighten from black to deep blue. By the time I turn onto their drive, there's enough light to see the fields, the farmhouse.

And the destroyed fence I'm here to fix.

I park near the barn, kill the engine. The farm is quiet except for birds waking up, singing like everything's normal.

The farmhouse door opens. Claire steps out, already dressed for work. Her hair's in a braid down her back. She's heading toward the barn.

I force myself out of the Chevy. Claire's already at the tool shed, unlocking it.

"You're early," she says without looking at me. "That's good."

I check my watch. Five fifty-five. "You said six."

"Most people show up late their first day." She opens the shed door, gestures inside. "Grab a hammer, a pry bar, and work gloves if your hands aren't tough enough yet."

The comment stings, but I let it go. I step in and find what she asked for. The hammer's well-balanced. The pry bar is solid steel, heavy. I grab leather work gloves.

When I come back out, Claire's already walking toward the destroyed fence, carrying her tools. I follow.

The fence looks worse up close than on Saturday. Thirty feet of complete destruction. My stomach drops. This is going to take forever.

"We'll start with clearing," Claire says, setting her tools down. "All the broken wood needs to be pulled out and hauled away. Pile it over there—" She points near the barn. "We'll burn it later."

"Okay."

"Then we'll pull out the broken posts. Some snapped at ground level, we'll dig them out. Others broke higher up, we can cut them off. Every post has to come out clean before we can put new ones in."

I nod. "How long will this take?"

"The clearing? Couple hours if we work steady. Pulling the posts? Depends on how deep they're set. Could be all day just for this section."

All day. And this is just the beginning.

Claire picks up a broken fence rail and tosses it aside like it weighs nothing. I grab a splintered piece and add it to the pile. The work is simple—pick up broken wood, throw it aside. Over and over. Not complicated, just endless.

We work in silence. Claire moves efficiently, no wasted motion. Every piece gets examined—if it's salvageable, she sets it aside. If it's too damaged, it goes on the burn pile. I follow her lead.

The sun rises higher, warming the June morning. By seven AM, I'm sweating through my shirt. By eight, my back's aching. Claire doesn't seem tired at all. Just keeps working, steady and methodical.

"Water break," she says around eight-thirty.

We walk to the oak tree. There's a jug of water in the shade—someone brought it out. Claire pours water into two tin cups, hands me one.

I drink gratefully. The water's cold and perfect.

"You're doing okay," Claire says, leaning against the tree. "Moving faster than I expected."

It's the first thing she's said that isn't an instruction. "Thanks?"

She almost smiles. "Most people complain by now. About the heat or their back or how much work there is."

"Would complaining make it go faster?"

"No."

"Then what's the point?"

This time she does smile, small and quick. "Fair enough."

We drink in silence. Comfortable silence, which is new for me. Usually silence means someone's angry or judging. But Claire's just... quiet.

"How long have you been doing farm work?" I ask.

"Since I could walk. My dad started me early. Got harder as I got older. Now I do everything he does except drive the tractor, and that's only because he won't teach me."

I remember her saying that.

"That's stupid," I say before I can stop myself.

Claire looks at me, eyebrows raised.

"I mean—if you're working the farm anyway, you should know how to do all of it." I stop. "Sorry. Not my business."

"No, you're right." Claire sets her cup down. "It is stupid. I've been telling him that for two years. He doesn't listen."

"Parents don't usually listen when you're right. Makes them feel like they're losing control."

"Sounds like you've got experience with that."

I shrug. "Different situation. My father doesn't care what I do as long as I stay out of his way."

Claire's quiet for a moment. Then she just nods. "Break's over. We've still got work before the real heat kicks in."

We head back to the fence. Most of the broken wood is cleared, leaving just the posts—some snapped at ground level, some broken partway up.

"We'll start with the ones that broke high," Claire says, pointing to a post that snapped about three feet up. "Cut them off at ground level, then dig out what's left. The ones that snapped at ground level, we'll dig around and pry them out."

She hands me a saw, shows me the angle. "Like this. Let the saw do the work, don't force it."

I start cutting. It's harder than it looks—the wood is dense, the saw wants to bind. But I keep at it. After a few minutes, the post drops away.

"Good," Claire says. "Now dig around the base."

I start digging. The ground is hard, packed tight. Every shovelful feels like chipping at concrete. Sweat drips down my face, soaking through my shirt.

I glance over. Claire's working on the next post, saw moving steadily. She's not even breathing hard.

An hour later, I've pulled out three posts. My hands are blistered even through the gloves, my shoulders screaming, my back feels like someone beat it with a pipe. Claire's pulled out four posts and looks like she could do four more without breaking a sweat.

"You're doing fine," she says. "First day is always the hardest. Your body's not used to it yet."

"How long until it is?"

"Couple weeks. You'll build up calluses, get stronger. It gets easier."

A couple weeks. I've got three months of this.

I attack the next post with more force than necessary. The shovel hits the ground hard, and I pry at the base. It doesn't budge. I try again, throwing my weight into it. Still nothing.

Frustration builds in my chest, hot and familiar. This stupid post won't move, my hands hurt, my back hurts, and I'm supposed to do this for twelve hours a day, six days a week, all summer.

I slam the shovel down again, harder. The post shifts maybe an inch.

"Come on," I mutter.

I grab the pry bar, jam it under the post, and lever it up with everything I've got. The post tilts, but the base is stuck. I slam the pry bar down again, frustration bleeding into anger.

"Damn it!"

Louder than I meant. I expect Claire to say something—tell me to calm down, stop acting like a hothead.

But she doesn't.

I glance over. She's watching me, hammer in hand, completely calm. Not scared, not annoyed. Just watching.

"What?" I snap.

"Nothing." She turns back to her work. "Keep going. You'll get it."

That's it? No lecture?

I stare at her, then turn back to the post. Take a breath. Try the pry bar again, steadier, more controlled. The post shifts, gives a little more. I work it back and forth, loosening the earth. Finally, with one more solid pull, it comes free.

I stand there holding the broken post, breathing hard.

"See?" Claire says without looking up. "You got it."

We work for another hour. By noon, the destroyed section is completely cleared—all the broken wood piled for burning, all the damaged posts removed. The fence line looks strange, empty and bare.

Claire wipes her hands on her jeans. "Good. That's what I wanted done this morning."

"We're done?"

"With this part. This afternoon we'll start measuring and marking for new posts. But first, lunch."

She starts toward the farmhouse, and I follow. My legs feel wobbly, my hands throbbing.

Under the oak tree, Claire pulls a metal lunchbox from the shade and two mason jars of lemonade. She hands me one.

"Sit," she says, settling against the tree trunk.

I sit, grateful to be off my feet. The lemonade is cold and sweet and possibly the best thing I've ever tasted. I drink half before I think about slowing down.

Claire's watching me again, that calm, assessing look.

"What?" I ask, carefully this time.

"You're stronger than you think you are," she says. "You're just angry about being here."

The words catch me off guard.

"I don't blame you," she continues. "Nobody wants to spend their summer doing forced labor. But you'll make it harder on yourself if you fight it the whole time."

"I'm not fighting it."

"You're fighting something." She opens her lunchbox, pulls out a sandwich. "That post didn't do anything to you, but you were ready to kill it."

I look away, embarrassed. She's right.

"It's okay to be angry," Claire says quietly. "Just don't let it make you stupid. You'll hurt yourself or break something, and then you'll be here even longer fixing what you messed up."

I take another drink, let her words sink in. She's not judging me. Just telling me the truth.

"I'll try," I say finally.

"That's all I'm asking." Claire takes a bite of her sandwich, then holds out the lunchbox. "You bring lunch?"

"No."

She sighs, pulls out a second sandwich. "Here. Can't have you passing out from hunger."

I take it, surprised. "Thanks."

"Don't thank me. Just keep working this afternoon without trying to murder any innocent posts."

Despite everything—the exhaustion, the pain, the knowledge that this is only day one—I almost smile.

Maybe this won't be complete hell after all.

Maybe.
