# Chapter 24: Starting Over

Friday morning I show up at the Henderson farm before dawn. Before the sun, before the birds, before even Tom Henderson is awake.

I want to prove something. To Henderson, to Claire, to myself—that Wednesday was an aberration. A moment of weakness. Not who I really am or who I'm becoming.

I want to prove I'm not giving up.

So I'm there early, sitting in my Chevy in the farmyard, watching the sky lighten from black to dark blue to that pale gray that comes just before sunrise. My ribs still ache when I breathe deep, and my knuckles are still scabbed over, but I'm here.

That has to count for something.

Henderson comes out of the house around five-thirty, coffee mug in hand. He sees the Chevy, sees me sitting there, and nods like he expected nothing less.

"You're early," he says when I get out.

"Yes, sir."

"Sleep okay?"

It's a simple question, but we both know what he's really asking. I slept better than I have in days, actually. Cried myself out in the barn and then went home and fell into bed and didn't wake up until the alarm went off.

"Better," I say honestly.

Henderson studies me for a moment. In the early light, his face looks tired, older. Running a farm is hard work, and dealing with a hothead kid and his drunk father probably doesn't make it any easier.

"Your father came by last night," Henderson says quietly.

My stomach drops. "What?"

"Around nine. Drunk again." Henderson takes a sip of his coffee. "Started yelling from the driveway about how I can't keep him from his son. How you're a violent troublemaker and I should've turned you over to Sheriff Webb from the start."

I close my eyes. Of course he did. Of course my father couldn't just leave it alone.

"I'm sorry," I say. "I'll talk to him. I'll make him—"

"You won't do anything," Henderson interrupts firmly. "I handled it. Told him if he ever sets foot on my property again, I'll call Webb and press charges for trespassing. Then I stood there and waited until he drove off."

He drains the last of his coffee and sets the mug on the Chevy's hood.

"Your father's not welcome here, Rick. But you are. Those are two different things, and I need you to understand that."

The words settle in my chest, warm and solid.

"I understand," I say.

"Good." Henderson pulls his work gloves from his back pocket. "We've got fence to finish. You up for it?"

"Yes, sir."

We walk toward the fence line together, and it feels normal. Like the last few days didn't happen. Like it's just another Friday morning at the Henderson farm.

But it did happen. And I can't pretend it didn't.

"Henderson," I say as we're gathering tools. "About Wednesday—"

"We already talked about that," he says. "You want to keep apologizing, or you want to do better?"

I close my mouth. Nod.

"Then let's get to work."

We spend the morning finishing the fence repairs. It's familiar work now—my hands know what to do without thinking. Measure, cut, nail. Check for level. Move to the next section.

The rhythm is soothing. Physical work that lets my mind go quiet.

Around mid-morning, I hear footsteps behind us. Turn to see Claire walking across the farmyard carrying a tray with a pitcher of lemonade and cups.

My heart does that thing where it speeds up and my chest feels tight. But it's not the bad kind of tight. It's the kind that makes me hyperaware of everything—the way the morning sun catches her hair, the way she's wearing that blue dress I like, the way she's looking at me like Wednesday didn't change anything.

"Thought you could use a break," she says, setting the tray down on a fence post.

"Thanks," Henderson says, pouring himself a cup.

Claire looks at me. "Can I talk to you for a minute?"

My stomach flips. "Sure."

We walk a little ways away from her father, far enough that he can't hear us. Claire's carrying something—a first aid kit, I realize.

"Sit," she says, pointing to a hay bale near the barn.

"I'm fine—"

"Rick. Sit."

I sit.

Claire opens the first aid kit and pulls out antiseptic and bandages. She kneels in front of me and takes my right hand, turning it over so she can see my knuckles.

The scabs have started to form, but they're still ugly—split skin and bruises turning yellow-green at the edges.

"This is going to sting," she warns.

Then she dabs antiseptic on the wounds, and I have to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from swearing. It burns like hell.

"Sorry," Claire says, but she doesn't stop. Just keeps cleaning the wounds carefully, her hands gentle but thorough.

I watch her work. Watch the concentration on her face. The way she bites her lower lip when she's focused. The way her fingers are so careful with my bruised knuckles.

She's not scared. Not disgusted. Just tending to my wounds like it's the most natural thing in the world.

"Why are you doing this?" I ask quietly.

"Because you won't do it yourself," she says, moving to my left hand. "And because someone should."

"I don't deserve—"

"Stop." She looks up at me, her eyes firm. "Stop deciding what you do and don't deserve. That's not your call to make."

"Whose call is it?"

"Mine." She goes back to cleaning my knuckles. "And I say you deserve to have someone take care of you for once."

The words hit me hard. I can't remember the last time someone took care of me. My mother, maybe, before she left. But that was five years ago. Five years of taking care of myself, of cleaning my own wounds and fixing my own problems and not expecting anything from anyone.

Claire wraps my knuckles with clean bandages, her movements practiced and sure.

"There," she says, sitting back on her heels. "Better."

"Yeah," I manage. "Better."

She stands up, brushes dirt from her dress. "I'll let you get back to work."

But she doesn't leave. Just stands there looking at me, and I can't read her expression.

"What?" I finally ask.

"I'm glad you came back," she says simply.

Then she walks away, carrying the first aid kit, leaving me sitting on the hay bale with bandaged hands and a heart that feels like it might explode out of my chest.

I watch her go. Watch her walk back toward the farmhouse, the sun making her hair shine gold.

I'm in love with her.

The thought isn't new—I've known it for weeks now. But sitting here with my hands wrapped in clean bandages, watching her disappear into the house, the certainty of it hits me all over again.

I'm completely, hopelessly in love with Claire Henderson.

And somehow, miraculously, she still wants me around.

I stand up and head back to where Henderson's working on the fence. He doesn't ask what Claire wanted, just hands me a hammer and points to the next section that needs work.

We work through the afternoon, stopping for lunch and then pushing through until the worst of the heat breaks around three. The fence is looking good now—sturdy and straight, all the damage from Wednesday repaired.

Like it never happened.

Except it did happen. And I'm not pretending it didn't.

But I'm also not letting it define me.

Around five, Henderson steps back and surveys our work. Nods with satisfaction.

"Good work today," he says.

"Thanks."

He turns to look at me, and there's something in his expression that makes me stand up straighter.

"I've been thinking about this summer," he says. "About the deal we made. About the work you've done."

My chest tightens. This is it. This is where he tells me I've fulfilled my obligations and I'm free to go.

"You've exceeded every expectation I had," Henderson continues. "When I made you that deal, I figured I'd get some half-hearted labor from a kid who resented being here. Maybe fix my fence and teach you a lesson about consequences."

He pulls off his work gloves, tucks them in his back pocket.

"But you showed up every morning. Worked hard. Learned fast. Proved you're not just some troublemaker from the wrong side of town."

I don't know what to say to that.

"I'm proud of you, Rick," Henderson says. "I wanted you to know that."

The words land like a punch to the gut. The good kind. The kind that takes your breath away because you never expected them.

Nobody's ever said they're proud of me before.

"Thank you, sir," I manage.

Henderson nods. "We've got two more weeks before school starts. You planning to keep showing up?"

"Yes, sir. I gave you my word for the whole summer."

"You did." Henderson almost smiles. "But you've more than paid off what you owe. The fence is fixed, the garden's replanted, you've done a month of extra work beyond that. If you wanted to call it even and head out, I wouldn't blame you."

He's giving me an out. A clean exit from this whole situation.

And I realize I don't want it.

"I'd like to finish the summer," I say. "If that's okay with you."

"More than okay," Henderson says. "I could use the help. And I think..." He pauses, choosing his words carefully. "I think you could use the stability."

He's right. I need this. Need the routine of showing up every morning, need the satisfaction of physical work, need the anchor of knowing exactly where I'm supposed to be and what I'm supposed to do.

Need to see Claire every day.

"Two more weeks," I say.

"Two more weeks," Henderson agrees. "Then school starts and we'll figure out what comes next."

What comes next. The future. Something I haven't let myself think about much because thinking about the future means admitting this summer has to end.

Means admitting that soon I won't have an excuse to see Claire every single day.

The thought makes my chest ache.

But I push it away. Focus on now. On today. On the fact that I have two more weeks of mornings at the Henderson farm and afternoons working beside Claire and evenings where Tom Henderson tells me I'm doing good work.

Two more weeks of being the person I want to be instead of the person everyone expects.

Two more weeks to figure out if I can hold onto this when the summer ends.

It's not enough time.

But it's what I have.

And I'm going to make every day count.
