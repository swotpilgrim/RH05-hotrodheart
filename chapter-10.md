# Chapter 10: The First Truth

After we get back to work, everything feels different.

Not the work itself—we're still digging around fence posts, still packing gravel, still checking levels. But something between Claire and me has shifted.

Maybe it's that I told her the truth. Maybe it's that she didn't run.

We work in silence for the next hour, but it's not the uncomfortable silence from those first weeks. This is something heavier, more aware. Like the air itself knows I just confessed things I've never said out loud.

My hand throbs where I punched the post. The bandana Claire wrapped around my knuckles is spotted with blood, but I keep working. Need to keep moving, or I'll start thinking too hard about what I just said.

Nobody's ever asked me what I'm really angry about before. Teachers tell me to calm down. Sheriff Webb tells me to get control of myself. Bobby tells me to channel it into racing. My father—well, my father's usually the cause of it, so he doesn't get a vote.

But Claire asked. And I answered.

Told her about coming home to find Frank drunk on the couch, the smell of whiskey and vomit. About cleaning up broken bottles before I go to bed because if I don't, he'll cut his feet and blame me for it. About the weight of knowing I'm one bad day away from becoming exactly what he is.

I told her, and she didn't flinch. Didn't look at me like I was broken or dangerous. Just listened. Then wrapped my bleeding hand.

"Hand me the level," Claire says, and I pass it to her.

She checks the post we just set, adjusts it slightly. I pack more gravel around the base without being asked. We've developed this rhythm where we don't need to explain every little thing—just work together until the job's done.

Except now I'm hyperaware of every movement. Every time our hands get close when passing tools. Every time she glances at me.

I'm not okay. But I'm not falling apart either.

"That one's good," Claire says, stepping back. "Next post."

We move down the fence line. This time I grab the shovel instead of the sledgehammer. Safer that way.

Claire works on the opposite side of the post, digging around the base. We fall into the familiar pattern—dig, loosen, check, dig deeper.

But my mind won't shut up.

I keep thinking about the look on Claire's face when I told her I'm terrified of becoming my father. Expected pity, maybe. Or that careful distance people get when they realize you're damaged.

But that's not what I saw. She just looked steady. Like nothing changed.

"You're thinking too loud," Claire says without looking up.

"What?"

"I can practically hear the wheels turning." She tosses a shovelful of dirt aside. "Whatever you're overthinking, stop."

"I'm not overthinking anything."

"Yes, you are. You've been digging the same spot for three minutes. The post is already loose."

I look down. She's right—I've been stabbing at dirt that's already moved, working on autopilot while my brain spins in circles.

"Sorry."

"Don't apologize. Just help me pull this thing out."

We grab the post together and work it back and forth until it comes free. The bottom is completely rotted—barely any solid wood left.

"How many of these posts did you know needed work?" I ask.

"Most of them." Claire wipes her forehead. "My father's been putting off maintenance. Too busy with crops."

"So I'm actually being useful."

"Don't let it go to your head." But there's almost a smile in her voice.

We grab a new post and carry it to the hole together. It's heavy—takes both of us. Claire holds it steady while I pack gravel around the base.

The work is hot, dirty, repetitive. Should be miserable. But there's something satisfying about it—taking something broken and making it right.

Maybe that's what I'm trying to do with myself.

By noon, we've replaced four more posts. My shirt is soaked with sweat, my good hand is cramping, and the wrapped hand is screaming. But the fence line is starting to look right—straight and strong instead of sagging and rotted.

"Water break," Claire announces, and we head to the oak tree.

She pours two cups from the jug. I drink mine in three long gulps. Claire sips hers slower, watching me.

"What?" I ask.

"Your hand needs proper cleaning. Splinters need to come out before they get infected."

"It's fine."

"It's not fine. There's wood embedded in your knuckles." She sets her cup down. "After lunch, we're going to the house. My mother has a first aid kit."

"I don't need—"

"Rick." Claire cuts me off. "This isn't a suggestion. If they get infected, you can't work. So we're getting them cleaned and bandaged."

She's right. And my knuckles do hurt worse than I'm letting on.

"Okay," I say.

Claire nods and goes back to her water. We sit in the shade. Simple. Steady.

"Thank you," I say suddenly.

"For what?"

"For not..." I trail off. For not running? For not treating me like I'm broken?

"For not what?" Claire prompts.

I look at her. She's got dirt on her face and hay in her hair from this morning's barn work. Her hands are as calloused as mine. She looks like what she is—a farm girl who works hard.

But she's more than that. She's the person who didn't flinch when I lost control. The person who asked what I was really angry about. The person treating me like a person, not a problem.

"For not making it a big deal," I say finally. "This morning. When I lost it."

"You punched a fence post and bled on my property." There's almost amusement in her voice. "I wouldn't call that nothing."

"You know what I mean."

"I do." Claire sets her cup down. "But you're the one making it a big deal, Rick. You got angry, you hit something, you calmed down, we talked, we went back to work. That's all."

"That's all?"

"That's all. You're a person with anger issues working them out. I'm a person supervising. We both have jobs to do."

She makes it sound so simple. Like I didn't just confess my deepest fears. Like this is just another day.

And maybe for her, it is.

But for me, something changed. I told Claire Henderson the truth about my father, about my fears.

And she's still here. Still working beside me. Still treating me like I'm worth something.

That shouldn't matter as much as it does.

We finish our water and head back to work. The afternoon passes in more fence repair—dig, remove, replace, pack, level. By the time Claire calls it for the day around six, we've replaced eight posts total. Good progress.

"Come on," she says. "Let's get your hand taken care of."

We walk to the farmhouse. Claire leads me through the back door into a tidy kitchen that smells like fresh bread.

Mrs. Henderson is at the sink. She looks up when we come in, and her eyes go straight to the bloody bandana wrapped around my hand.

"What happened?"

"He punched a fence post," Claire says. "Needs splinters pulled and proper bandaging."

Mrs. Henderson doesn't ask why. Just dries her hands and pulls out a first aid kit. "Sit down, Rick. Let me see."

I sit at the kitchen table while she unwraps Claire's bandana. The knuckles underneath are swollen, crusted with blood.

Claire sits across from me while her mother works. Mrs. Henderson is gentle but thorough, cleaning the wounds, pulling splinters with tweezers, applying antiseptic that stings. I keep my jaw clenched.

"Keep this clean," Mrs. Henderson says as she wraps my hand in proper gauze. "Change the bandage tomorrow. If you see any redness or swelling, you come back. Understood?"

"Yes, ma'am."

She pats my shoulder. "Good. Now both of you wash up for dinner."

I look at Claire, surprised.

"You're staying," Claire says. Not a question. "My mother made pot roast."

"I should get home."

"To what? An empty house and your father passed out?" Claire's voice is gentle, but there's steel underneath. "Stay. Eat something real."

She's not wrong. My father will be drunk by now, and there's nothing waiting for me except more reasons to be angry.

"Okay," I say. "Thank you."

Dinner with the Hendersons is quiet and comfortable. Tom Henderson asks about the fence progress, nods approvingly when Claire reports eight posts replaced. Mrs. Henderson makes sure I eat seconds. Nobody asks about my hand or why I'm really there.

They just treat me like a normal person sharing a meal. Like I belong.

And that's what gets me. Not Claire's acceptance, not Mrs. Henderson's gentle care, not Tom Henderson's approval.

It's that they're treating me like I matter. Like I'm worth feeding and caring about.

I drive home after dinner with my properly bandaged hand and a full stomach, and the house I pull up to looks even more depressing than usual. Paint peeling. Yard overgrown. My father's beat-up truck parked crooked in the drive.

I sit in the Chevy for a minute, not ready to go inside yet.

Today I told someone the truth about my father. About my fear of becoming him. And instead of judgment or pity, I got acceptance. Got dinner with a family that actually talks to each other. Got my hand wrapped by someone who noticed I was hurt.

I'm not stupid. I know this doesn't fix anything. My father's still an alcoholic. I'm still the Dalton kid with a reputation. I'm still here because I crashed through the Henderson fence.

But something is different now. I told the truth, and the world didn't end. Claire didn't run.

Maybe I'm not as broken as I thought.

Or maybe I'm just broken in a way that someone finally understands.

Either way, for the first time in a long time, I don't feel completely alone.

And that's enough for today.
